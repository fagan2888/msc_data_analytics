# Monte Carlo simulation for decision making under uncertainty

## Generate random varibles ------------------------------------------------------------
# performance of built-in generators - uniform distribution
Nsim = 10^4 # number of random numbers -> significanctly large assures randomness
            # them to be uniformly distributed
x = runif(Nsim) # uniform generator, arg: the number of values to be generated
                # in reality runif is deterministic sequence based on a random starting point
# runif(100, min=2, max=5) # min and max are optional arguments

x1 = x[-Nsim] #vectors to plot
x2 = x[-1] #adjacent pairs
par(mfrow = c(1,3))

# Visualise to check the properties of this uniform generator
# i.e. we want to see that the distribution is indeed random
hist(x,cex.lab = 2, cex.axis=2, cex.main=2, cex.sub=2) # histogram
plot(x1,x2,cex.lab = 2, cex.axis=2, cex.main=2, cex.sub=2) # plot the pairs
acf(x,cex.lab = 2, cex.axis=2, cex.main=2, cex.sub=2) # estimate autocorrelation function


## Deterministic sequence based on the seed ---------------------------------------------
# Produces the same sequence: setting the seed determines all the subsequent values
set.seed(1)
runif(5)
set.seed(1)
runif(5)
set.seed(2)
runif(5)


## Inverse transform to generate non-standard distributions -------------------------------
# Different methods do generate the same
Nsim=10^4 #number of random variables
U=runif(Nsim)
X=-log(1-U) #transforms of uniforms
Y=rexp(Nsim) #exponentials from R
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) #plots
hist(X,freq=F,main="Exp from Uniform")
hist(Y,freq=F,main="Exp from R")
