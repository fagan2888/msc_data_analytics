# SRF: log(pred_ceo_salary) = 6.5055 + 0.0097 ceo_tenure 
# Sample size: 177 CEOs were surveyed
# R-squared: 0.0132 - this means that only 1.32% of the variation in the log(salary) is explained
# by CEO tenure. It is likely that other performance variables explain most of the variation in
# CEO salaries. Some examples of variables that directly impact CEO salaries are:
# What industries the companies operate in, something that determines profit margins. Also whether
# or not the company is publicly listed, shareholder backgrounds and interests, the size of the 
# company along with many many other factors.

## 2. Data on births to women in the United States including information on infant birth weight 
## in ounces (bwght), and the average number of cigarettes the mother smoked per day during 
## pregnancy (cigs).
load(file="bwght.RData")

# A.  Regression/Fitted model for the relationship between birthweight and cigarettes smoked per
# day during pregnancy:
# SRF: pred_bwght = 119.7719 - 0.5137 cigs 
# Sample size: 1,388 new mothers were surveyed
# R-squared: 0.0227 - this means that only 2.27% of the variation of the predicted bwght is 
# explained the mothers smoking habits. It is likely that other variables have a higher impact on
# the variation in the bwght. Some examples of variables that directly impact the childs bwght 
# include:
# Access to prenatal care, level of income, the nutritional habits of the expectant mother, family
# structure and support, genetical predispositions as well as many many other variables.
# It may alsobe that there are not enough data points on smoking mothers in the sample size. Only
# 212 out of the 1388 or 15% of the surveyed mother reported to have been smoking during their
# pregnancy. It is possible that mothers did not want to admit to having smoked during their
# pregnancy or even that the smoking is correlated with other issues such as stress or poor 
# health or predominant in specific demographic subsets.

bwghtCigs.model <- lm(formula=bwght~cigs, data=data)
summary(bwghtCigs.model)

length(data$cigs[data$cigs>0])/length(data$cigs)

# B. The predicted bwght for when the mother smokes 0 cigs per day to when she smokes 20 cigs per 
# day is not significant given the spread in the whole sample where the median is 120 ounces. It
# would appear the correlation between the two variables is not significant.
# The predicted birth weight when cigs = 0 : approx. 119.7719 ounces
# The predicted birth weight when cigs = 20 : approx. 109.4979 ounce

summary(data$bwght)


# C. This does not necessarily imply that there is a causal relationship between the child's bwght
# and the motherâ€™s smoking habits during the pregnancy. Two main reasons for this come to mind:
# i. As outlined in question A the sample does not include many expectant mother that smoked. Either
# the regression should be done on a larger data set or with analternative regression model.
# ii. The assumption for the regression model includes assumptions that rarely hold in real life.
# Amongst those is the zero conditional mean assumption (ZCM), a restrictive assumption that states
# E(u|x) = 0 i.e. that 'x' or 'cigs' is not correlated to anything other that might affect the 
# childs bwght. Though as outlined in question A. a few suggestions come to mind that might 
# not allow this to be true in this case.


# D. To predict a birth weight of 125 ounces, cigs perday would then have to be -10.1773, which
# is a nonsensical value for number of cigarettes smoked per day. Given that the OLS model assumes
# the data is normally distributed around the estimates, negative values are not impossible. 
# Given the relatively low occurance of smaoking during pregnancy it might be better to get 
# estimates from a model that uses an alternative distribution, such as a Poisson.


# E. The fact that that the proportion of women in the sample who do not smoke while pregnant is
# about 85% reconciles with my findings and deliberation in questions A. and D.
