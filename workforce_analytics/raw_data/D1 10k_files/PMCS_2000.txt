GLOSSARY OF TERMS
- -----------------

We use a  number  of  terms  in this  report  which  are  familiar  to  industry
participants  but which some  investors  may not  recognize.  We have provided a
glossary of some of these terms below.

ATM: Asynchronous Transfer Mode - a high speed switching technology used in both
LAN and WAN  applications.  ATM packages  information  in a fixed size (53 byte)
cell format. ATM transmission rates can scale from 25 megabits per second (Mbps)
to 10 gigabits per second (Gbps).

Bandwidth: 1. The range of frequencies that can be utilized without interference
from an outside  transmission of data packets between modules.  2. The volume of
data  that  a  transmission  line  can  carry,  measured  in  bits  per  second.
Traditional copper lines have the lowest bandwidth potential,  while fiber optic
lines have the highest.

Constant Bit Rate (CBR): A type of traffic that requires a continuous,  specific
amount of bandwidth  over the ATM network.  This is typically  required for high
quality video and digital voice transmission.

Dense Wavelength  Division  Multiplexing  (DWDM): An extension of WDM technology
that allows  simultaneous  transmission  of more than four  channels on a single
fiber.

Digital Subscriber Line:  Point-to-point public network access technologies that
allow multiple forms of data,  voice, and video to be carried over  twisted-pair
copper  wire on the local  loop  between a network  service  provider's  central
office and the customer site at limited  distances.  Most DSL technologies don't
use the full  bandwidth  of the  twisted-pair,  leaving  enough room for a voice
channel.

Ethernet: A standard protocol used in the LAN that encompasses both layer 1 (the
transmission  and  reception  of bits) and layer 2 (the  packaging  of data into
frames)  functions.  Ethernet  supports data transfer rates of 10Mbps.  The Fast
Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet  standards are compatible with previous  standards
generations  and  support  data  transfer  rates  of 100 Mbps  and  1,000  Mbps,
respectively.

Frame Relay: A  packet-switching  technology used to route frames of information
within a WAN.  Instead of leasing  dedicated  lines between all remote sites,  a
virtual  private network is established in which remote sites are connected to a
central carrier, which routes data accordingly.

Gigabit:  One billion bits.

HDLC:  High-level  Data  Link  Control  -  A  transmission   protocol  in  which
information  that  allows  devices to control  data flow and  correct  errors is
embedded in a data frame. Typically used for frame relay services.

Internet  Protocol (IP): A routing  protocol  standard that is used by Microsoft
Windows  95,  Windows  NT,  the UNIX  operating  system,  and the  Internet.  IP
implements the network layer (Layer 3) of the TCP/IP protocol,  which contains a
network  address  and is used to  route a  message  to a  different  network  or
subnetwork.
<PAGE>

LAN:  Local Area Network - A shared network of computers that spans a relatively
small area, usually confined to a single or close cluster of buildings.

MAN:  Metropolitan  Area  Network  - A  communications  network  that  covers  a
geographic  area,  such as a city or suburb.  A series of LANs at multiple sites
often interconnected by public facilities.

Megabit: One million bits.

Multiplexing:  An electronic or optical  process that combines a large number of
low-speed  transmission  lines into one  high-speed  line by splitting the total
available  bandwidth of the high-speed line into narrower bands (known as FDM or
frequency  division),  or by  allotting  a common  channel to several  different
transmitting  devices,  one at a  time  in  sequence  (known  as  TDM,  or  time
division).

Packet:  A group of binary  digits  switched as a whole.  Each  packet  contains
information,  a destination  code,  and a sequencing  code in order to place the
data in proper place in the sequence of packets  that  comprise a complete  data
transmission and codes used to check the transmission errors.

Point-of-Presence  (POP):  1. A geographic  area within  which a  communications
network allows local access.  2.  Locations  where a  long-distance  carrier has
installed  transmission  equipment  in a service  area that serves as, or relays
calls  to, a network  switching  center of that  long-distance  carrier.  3. The
physical site where an Internet  service provider (ISP) has its modems and other
networking gear. Subscribers dial into the POP for Internet access.

Quality of Service  (QoS):  The  ability to define a level of  performance  in a
system.  For example,  ATM networks specify modes of service that ensure optimum
performance for traffic,  such as real-time voice and video.  Voice  information
receives  priority over data  information  in order to ensure speech quality and
prevent delay.

Router:  Device that connects  multiple LANs or the bridge between a LAN and the
WAN.

SDH:  Synchronous Digital Hierarchy - An international  standard for synchronous
data transmission  over fiber; SDH was adapted from SONET,  which is employed in
North America.

SONET:  Synchronous Optical Network - Standard for synchronous data transmission
over fiber. Rates are measured in optical carrier (OC) units. For example,  OC-1
equals rates of 51.84 Mbps and OC-3 equals rates of 155 Mbps.
The international equivalent is SDH.

T1/E1/J1: T1 is a digital transmission link with a capacity of 1.544 Mbps. A T-1
line can  normally  accommodate  24  voice  conversations  (channels),  each one
digitized at 64 Kbps and one 8-Kpbs channel for signaling and control. E1 is the
European  designation  for T1 and has a capacity of  approximately 2 Mbps. J1 is
the Japanese designation for T1.
<PAGE>

T3/E3/J2:  A data communications line capable of transmission speeds of 45 Mbps.
A T-3 line can normally accommodate 672 voice conversations.  E3 is the European
designation for T3 and J2 is the Japanese designation for T3.

Terabit:  One trillion bits.

WANs:  Wide Area  Network - A shared  network  of  computers  that spans a large
geographical area, normally consisting of multiple LANs or MANs.


INDUSTRY BACKGROUND
- -------------------

People are finding new and more demanding ways to use the world's communications
networks.  At home,  we use the Internet to shop,  pay our bills or  communicate
with each other. At the work site, we conduct on-line  meetings,  read the news,
share  data  across  departments,  download  reports,  sell  products  and order
supplies.  These  are  just a few of  the  applications  for  which  we use  the
worldwide communications infrastructure.

The way we use the world's  networks  today is a relatively  recent  phenomenon.
Until  just a few years  ago,  the  world's  networks  were  primarily  used for
telephone calls and facsimile  transmissions.  Billions of dollars were spent by
traditional  phone  companies  to supply  reliable  networks  to  provide  these
services.  The Internet was just a dream resident at colleges and  universities.
Now the Internet has become much more broadly  adopted,  and the public  expects
the  networks of the world to supply the  capacity to support  large  volumes of
data traffic in addition to phone conversations.

The Bandwidth Suppliers

Two major  types of network  bandwidth  suppliers  are  trying to address  these
rapidly evolving networking demands:  traditional  telephone companies,  such as
AT&T, MCI Worldcom and Sprint, and new data-centric competitive carriers such as
Williams,  Level 3 and UUNET.  These bandwidth  suppliers have used a variety of
technologies to deliver their network  services.  Many of the traditional  phone
companies  prefer  "multi-service"  Frame Relay and  Asynchronous  Transfer Mode
(ATM)  networks  in order  to  leverage  their  existing  infrastructures  while
providing the Quality of Service (QoS) required to support data, voice and other
communication  traffic. The newer carriers are more data-centric,  and thus have
preferred more Internet Protocol (IP) packet based data networks.

Today, the newest network  deployments are focusing on transporting  data, voice
and  other  communication  signals  over a single  multi-service  network.  Many
carriers  are building  networks  that  converge  (IP) layers over ATM and Frame
Relay sub-networks or directly onto fiber.

Carriers  which own  multi-service  networks  enter into  agreements  with their
customers to guarantee bandwidth for data or voice transport or Internet access.
These  agreements can enable carriers to increase  revenues as the most critical
traffic requirements can be guaranteed at a higher price.
<PAGE>

Carriers  can  commit to  particular  service  levels  because  the QoS  traffic
management  techniques  made possible by protocols such as ATM have developed an
excellent capability for providing QoS standard guarantees. Protocols such as IP
have less developed,  but rapidly improving,  QoS  characteristics.  The current
lack of acceptable IP-related QoS standards has prohibited the implementation of
IP across the emerging global network.  Thus,  multi-service  networks are still
preferred by most of the traditional phone companies.

The Data Wave

Many carriers  believe the next  generation of  communications  networks will be
IP-based,  as their networks will transport far more data than any other type of
traffic. Eventually, carriers intend to incorporate the exemplary redundancy and
reliability  aspects of the voice network  infrastructure in new next-generation
packet  networks  because they recognize that voice and other traffic will still
need to be  transported.  Consumers  expect  their  telephones  to work from the
moment  they pick up the  receiver  and hear the "dial  tone" to the moment they
hang it up, and they do not expect to "re-boot"  their  phones.  In keeping with
this  performance  expectation,  the  builders of the  Internet  will attempt to
develop IP networks that offer the same dependability.

The Optical Transport Network

The emergence of the Optical  Transport Network (OTN) - a network based on glass
and light  transmission,  rather than  electrical  transmission  - is one of the
greatest  evolutions  in the  broadband  networking  arena.  Most of the current
Internet  infrastructure  is based on electrical  transmission over copper wire.
Many carriers consider the massive  bandwidth  capacity provided by fiber optics
and Dense Wave Division Multiplexing (DWDM), a method of using color wavelengths
to create a new network "line" for every color, a more attractive investment for
long distance transmissions.

In 1999 various carriers deployed  thousands of miles of glass fiber underground
and alongside railway lines or petroleum  pipelines.  These deployments  provide
communications  capacity  within or across  continents  (i.e. the  WAN).Emerging
lower cost DWDM systems are now being  deployed in  Metropolitan  Area  Networks
(MANs).

The emergence of the OTN has resulted in an optical/electrical convergence where
optical functions mesh with electrically managed functions. In today's networks,
optical wavelengths  transport signals and electrical  semiconductors manage the
higher layer  protocols,  such as IP routing or switching.  PMC offers  products
that merge  existing  electrical-based  communications  protocols,  such as ATM,
SONET/SDH,  Internet  Protocol (IP) and Gigabit Ethernet with new  optical-based
protocols.  In the future,  emerging  technologies such as optical switching and
routing protocols will become increasingly important.

The standards for this electrical-to-optical  interface have not been finalized.
The networking  industry's  Optical Domain  Service  Interconnect  industry-wide
consortium  has over 100 service  providers  and  networking  vendors  which are
attempting to develop a standards-based approach to convergence. While standards
are evolving,  small companies are offering the innovation,  time to market, and
new  technology  required to enable  carriers to the upgrade  rapidly from their
existing circuit-based networks to an optical multi-service network.

<PAGE>

Systems  suppliers for optical  networking  applications  require  semiconductor
products with greater levels of integration, increased density, and higher speed
capabilities.  These  high-speed  techniques  must handle  access rates from 1.5
megabits per second to core  Internet  backbone  rates of 10 gigabits per second
and beyond.  They must use little power,  so that larger  networks may be built,
and comply with telephone company signal quality standards.

Specific Trends

The  following  specific  trends are important to  PMC-Sierra's  internetworking
semiconductor businesses:

- -        A growing  number of Internet  Service  Providers are using  networking
     equipment  to  aggregate  networking  traffic  from 64  kilobit  per second
     streams  with 155 Mbps or more of traffic  that will be sent on fiber lines
     onto the MAN and WAN core backbones of the Internet.

- -        For Remote Access data and voice networks,  network users are upgrading
     their Frame Relay networks to aggregate  additional  dedicated line traffic
     (such as telephones) and differentiate  data traffic protocol types such as
     ATM,  Frame  Relay  and IP.  These  new  applications  are  referred  to as
     Any-Service-Any-Port (ASAP).

- -        ATM networks are being  created  which can scale from low-rate 1.5 Mbps
     to  Terabit  rates for data,  voice and video  traffic  which  require  QoS
     guarantees.  ATM networks  are being used  increasingly  in  switching  and
     transmission systems that seek to provide QoS to customers.

- -        The current Internet  infrastructure  is dominated by router entry into
     WAN backbone fiber  networks.  Sometimes users sending this traffic require
     maximum  bandwidth.  These  users  may  forego  QoS  and  other  management
     processing  overhead  to get more  bandwidth.  In these  cases,  mapping IP
     directly into SONET/SDH  frames is more  efficient  because it does not use
     bandwidth for  undesired  overhead.  IP-Over-SONET/SDH  (POS) is a protocol
     used in Ethernet  switches as an uplink to MAN/WAN  fiber  backbone  rings,
     high-speed Terabit routers and remote access concentrators.  It maps packet
     traffic directly into SONET/SDH lines and is being deployed by carriers for
     these users.

- -        For residential Internet  opportunities,  the current 56 kilobit analog
     modem is a bottleneck.  Emerging  Digital  Subscriber Line (DSL) technology
     uses the  traditional  phone  lines to your home or office to provide up to
     several Mbps of bandwidth for Internet access.  New DSL access  multiplexer
     equipment is making the broad  deployment  of DSLs  possible by providing a
     manner  with  which  to  manage  all of the  network  traffic  to and  from
     customers using DSL services.  Cable modems are also providing  residential
     customers with higher bandwidth access methods to the internet.

- -        Carriers are rapidly  deploying base transceiver  stations for wireless
     services.  These stations convert waves of radio frequency air traffic into
     wired networks.  The wired networks then aggregate,  switch and process the
     signals at primarily T1 or E1 rates.  HDLC and ATM protocols are often used
     to interface and process the aggregated T1 and E1 lines.

Industry  analysts have recognized us as the market leader in ATM physical layer
solutions.  We  offer  LAN,  Edge and WAN core ATM  switch  chip  sets.  Our ATM
physical  layer products come in a variety of packages and provide the interface
to copper or fiber cabling along with framing and mapping  functions.  The S/UNI
product line offers physical layer solutions in a range from 1.5 megabits to 622
megabits.

Our line of RCMP/ATLAS  ATM layer  processors  handle higher layer ATM protocols
such as policing,  operations and management,  fault and performance monitoring,
while our ATM Switch chips offer a routing table and switching  element solution
capable of running at up to 622 megabytes per second.

In 1998, we added the S/UNI - ATLAS to our product portfolio.  This product is a
622 Mbit/s ATM Layer device which integrates traffic policing, fault management,
performance  monitoring,  address resolution and translation onto one chip. This
full duplex chip is intended for the broadband OC-3 and OC-12 interface required
for ATM edge, enterprise and core switches.

In 1999 we also  introduced  a chip set  consisting  of: The SPECTRA - 622,  the
TUPP+622  and the TEMAP.  These  SONET/SDH/T1/E1  products  provide the framing,
tributary  processing and mapping functions for fully  channelized  applications
such as multi-service add-drop multiplexers,  switches,  routers,  concentrators
and central  office  digital  cross-connects  for rates between DS-O (64 Kbit/s)
through to OC-12/STM4 (622 Mbit/s).

In  1999,  we  introduced  the  VORTEX  chipset,  an ATM or  packet-based  DSLAM
solution.  The  chipset  provides  traffic  management,  aggregation,  switching
maintenance  and  management  functions  for all DSL service  types.  The VORTEX
chipset is comprised of the S/UNI-Duplex line card multiplexer, the S/UNI-VORTEX
core card multiplexer and the S/UNI-APEX  traffic manager and switch. The VORTEX
chipset can be combined with the  S/UNI-ATLAS in DSLAM equipment used to provide
high speed consumer internet access,  as well as third generation  wireless base
stations, base station controllers and multi-service access equipment.

Our Remote Access products  include T1/E1 framers,  and high density Frame Relay
and HDLC controllers.  Our devices are used in data communications  applications
such as multi-service  and digital  subscriber line access  multiplexers,  frame
relay access  devices,  Internet  Protocol  routers,  wireless base stations and
remote   access   concentrators.   Our  access   products   are  also  used  for
telecommunications  applications such as private branch exchanges,  digital loop
carriers,  Class 5 switches,  digital  access cross  connect  systems,  add-drop
multiplexers and base transceiver stations.

In 1999, we introduced four new products representing the next generation of our
family of FREEDM high density  packet  processors.  The FREEDM 32P672 and FREEDM
32A672  support up to 672  simultaneous  HDLC channels  across up to 32 T1 or E1
links while the FREEDM 84P672 and FREEDM 84A672  support up to 672  simultaneous
HDLC channels across up to 84 T1 or E1 links. The "P" variety of FREEDM products
can be used in PCI-based remote access concentrators,  while the "A" variety can
be used in voice-over-IP gateways and frame relay interfaces.

In 1999,  we  introduced  the  TEMUX  chip to work  along  with  the new  FREEDM
products.   The  TEMUX  integrates  28  T1  framers,   21  E1  framers,  a  DS-3
framer/multiplexer  and SONET/SDH  mappers into a single chip. The  FREEDM/TEMUX
chip set provides a solution for  packet-based  T1/E1 over  channelized  DS-3 or
SONET/SDH  interfaces  used  in  Internet  access  switch,   router  and  access
multiplexer equipment.

Also in 1999, we introduced  the  S/UNI-JET,  a single channel J2, E3, T3 framer
with ATM cell  delineation.  The 3.3 volt  S/UNI-JET  is  designed  for  DSLAMs,
customer premise equipment routers, and access concentrators.

NON-NETWORKING PRODUCTS
- -----------------------

In the third  quarter  of 1996,  we  announced  our  decision  to exit the modem
chipset business and discontinue development of our custom chipsets. We disposed
of all modem-related  inventories in 1997. Our remaining non-networking products
are still  being  sold but we are not  planning  new  development  or  follow-on
products.  Revenues from other non-networking  products declined rapidly in 1998
and 1999.

SALES, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
- ---------------------------------

Our sales and marketing strategy is to be designed into our customers' equipment
by developing and selling  superior  products for which we will provide  premium
service and technical support. We maintain close working  relationships with our
customers  in order to make  products  that  address  their  needs.  We  provide
technical support to customers through field  application  engineers,  technical
marketing and factory systems engineers. We believe that providing comprehensive
product service and support is critical to shortening  customers'  design cycles
and maintaining a competitive position in the networking market.

We  sell  our   products   directly   and  through   distributors,   independent
manufacturers'  representatives and manufacturing  subcontractors.  Based on end
users and ignoring sales to distributors or sub-contractors, Lucent Technologies
and Cisco Systems each  represented  greater than 10% of our 1999  revenues.  In
1999, the country  purchasing the largest  percentage of our products outside of
the United States was Canada at 15%. Our  international  sales accounted for 31%
in 1999 , 32% in 1998 and 30% in 1997.

MANUFACTURING
- -------------

Independent  foundries and chip assemblers  manufacture all of our products.  We
receive  most of our  wafers  in  finished  form  from  Chartered  Semiconductor
Manufacturing  Ltd.  ("Chartered"),   and  Taiwan  Semiconductor   Manufacturing
Corporation  ("TSMC").   These  independent  foundries  produce  our  networking
products  at  feature  sizes  down to 0.25  micron.  We  believe  that by  using
independent foundries to fabricate our wafers, we are better able to concentrate
our resources on designing and testing new products.  In addition, we avoid much
of the capital cost associated with owning and operating a fabrication facility.

We have supply  agreements  with  Chartered  and TSMC.  We have made deposits to
secure access to wafer fabrication  capacity under both of these agreements.  At
December 31, 1999 and 1998,  we had $19.1 and $23.1  million,  respectively,  in
deposits with the foundries.  Under these agreements,  the foundries must supply
certain  quantities of wafers per year. Neither of these agreements have minimum
unit volume  requirements  but we are  obliged  under one of the  agreements  to
purchase a minimum  percentage of our total annual wafer  requirements  provided
that the foundry is able to continue to offer competitive  technology,  pricing,
quality and delivery.  The agreements may be terminated if either party does not
comply with the terms. We expect to spend $6.1 million in additional deposits to
secure  foundry  capacity  in 2000 and to  receive a refund of $4.6  million  of
existing deposits.

Wafers  supplied by outside  foundries  must meet our incoming  quality and test
standards.  We conduct the  majority of our test  operations  on advanced  mixed
signal and digital  test  equipment  in our Burnaby,  British  Columbia,  Canada
facility. The remainder of our testing is performed predominantly by independent
Asian companies.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
- ------------------------

Our  current  research  and  development  efforts are  targeted  at  integrating
multiple  channels  or  functions  on single  chips,  broadening  the  number of
products we provide to address varying protocols and networking  functions,  and
increasing the speeds at which our chips operate.

We  have  design  centers  in or near  Vancouver  (Canada),  Portland  (Oregon),
Gaithersburg  (Maryland),  San Jose  (California),  Galway  (Ireland),  Montreal
(Canada), Ottawa (Canada) and Saskatoon (Canada).

We spent $63.3 million in 1999, $35.9 million in 1998, and $22.9 million in 1997
on research and  development.  In 1998,  we also  expensed  $39.2  million of in
process  research  and  development,  $37.8  million  of  which  related  to the
acquisition of Integrated Telecom Technologies and $1.4 million of which related
to the acquisition of other technology.

BACKLOG
- -------

We sell primarily pursuant to standard short-term purchase orders. Our customers
frequently revise the quantity actually  purchased and the shipment schedules to
reflect changes in their needs. As of December 31, 1999, our backlog of products
scheduled for shipment within six months totaled $155.2 million.  As of December
31,  1998,  our backlog of products  scheduled  for  shipment  within six months
totaled $56.3  million.  Our  customers may cancel a significant  portion of the
backlog at their discretion  without penalty.  Accordingly,  we believe that our
backlog at any given time is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues.

COMPETITION
- -----------

The markets for our  products  are  intensely  competitive  and subject to rapid
technological  advancement  in design  tools,  wafer  manufacturing  techniques,
process  tools and  alternate  networking  technologies.  We must  identify  and
capture  future  market  opportunities  to offset the rapid price  erosion  that
characterizes  our  industry.  We may not be able to  develop  new  products  at
competitive pricing and performance levels. Even if we are able to do so, we may
not complete a new product and  introduce it to market in a timely  manner.  Our
customers  may  substitute  use of our products  with those of current or future
competitors.

We typically face  competition  at the design stage,  where  customers  evaluate
alternative design approaches that require integrated circuits.  Our competitors
have  increasingly  frequent  opportunities  to  supplant  our  products in next
generation  systems  because of shortened  product life and design-in  cycles in
many of our customers' products.

Major domestic and international  semiconductor  companies,  such as Intel, IBM,
and  Lucent  Technologies,  are  concentrating  an  increasing  amount  of their
substantially  greater  financial and other resources on the markets in which we
participate.  This  represents  a serious  competitive  threat to PMC.  Emerging
companies   also  provide   significant   competition  in  our  segment  of  the
semiconductor market.

Our competitors include Applied Micro Circuits Corporation,  Broadcom,  Conexant
Systems,  Cypress  Semiconductor,  Dallas  Semiconductor,   Galileo  Technology,
Integrated  Device  Technology,   IBM,  Infineon,  Intel,  Lucent  Technologies,
Motorola, MMC Networks, Texas Instruments, Transwitch and Vitesse Semiconductor.
Over the next few years,  we expect  additional  competitors,  some of which may
also have greater  financial and other  resources,  to enter the market with new
products.  In addition,  we are aware of venture-backed  companies that focus on
specific portions of our broad range of products. These companies,  individually
or collectively,  could represent  future  competition for many design wins, and
subsequent product sales.

LICENSES, PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
- --------------------------------

We have several U.S. patents and a number of pending patent  applications in the
U.S.  and  Europe.  In  addition to such  factors as  innovation,  technological
expertise and experienced personnel, we believe that a strong patent position is
becoming  increasingly  important to compete  effectively  in the  industry.  We
therefore have an active program to acquire additional patent protection.

We apply for mask work  protection  on our circuit  designs.  We also attempt to
protect our software,  trade secrets and other proprietary information by, among
other security measures,  entering into proprietary  information agreements with
employees.  Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously,  we do not know
if the measures we use will be successful.

PMC and its logo are our registered  trademarks and service marks.  We own other
trademarks  and service  marks not  appearing  in this Form 10-K Annual  Report.
Other  trademarks  used in this  Form  10-K  Annual  Report  are  owned by other
entities.

EMPLOYEES
- ---------

As of  December  31,  1999,  the  Company had 660  employees,  including  376 in
research  and  development,  100 in  production  and quality  assurance,  110 in
marketing and sales and 74 in administration.  Our employees are not represented
by a  collective  bargaining  agreement.  We have  never  experienced  any  work
stoppage. We believe our employee relations are good.
