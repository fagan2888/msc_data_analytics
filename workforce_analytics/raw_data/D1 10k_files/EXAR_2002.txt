Industry Background 
 
Communications technology has evolved from simple analog voice signals transmitted over networks of copper telephone lines to complex analog and digital voice and data signals transmitted over hybrid networks of media, such as copper, coaxial and fiber optic cables. This evolution has been driven by large increases in the number of users and the complexity and variety of the data transmitted over networks, resulting from: 
 
  •   the substantial growth in the Internet and its transformation from a text-based medium to a multimedia  

 
  •   platform containing pictures, video and sound;  

 
  •   the growth of wireless communications; and  

 
  •   the increased demand for remote network access and higher speed, higher bandwidth communication between LANs, MANs, and WANs.  

 
The majority of installed communications systems were designed to transmit only voice communications and, therefore, are inadequate for the high-bandwidth transmission of both voice and data. As a result, new equipment is being deployed to augment existing transmission media and increase their bandwidth. Access to the public network is typically based on asynchronous technologies, such as T/E carrier over copper wire. The demand for greater bandwidth is driving a migration from lower-speed T1/E1 to higher-speed T3/E3 transmission rates. The T1/E1 standard permits the transmission of data at 1.5 Mbps /2.0 Mbps, and the T3/E3 standard permits the transmission of data at 45 Mbps/34 Mbps. The backbone of the public network is built on an optical fiber transmission medium that employs synchronous technologies such as SONET/SDH. Similar to the

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

utilization of faster transmission rates over copper wire, SONET/SDH protocols such as OC–3 (1.554 Mbps) and OC-12 (622 Mbps) are being upgraded to OC-48 (2.5 Gbps) and OC-192 (10 Gbps) to increase the bandwidth over a single optical fiber. 
 
The market dynamics of the communications industry have changed significantly since 2000. Many carriers that spent billions of dollars building out their networks in 2000 were not successful in executing their business models and consequently were sold or declared bankruptcy. Incumbent telephone companies (such as AT&T, Sprint, MCI and Worldcom) and regional bell operating companies (such as BellSouth, Verizon and SBC) have substantially scaled back their capital expenditures in an effort to bring them in line with historical spending levels. This dynamic has severely impacted Exar’s customers, communications equipment OEMs, or original equipment manufacturers, many of which have undergone or are undergoing extensive restructuring to eliminate excess inventory and to reduce expenses by significantly downsizing their organizations. At the same time, despite these economic setbacks, the Company’s OEM customers are and will continue to come under tremendous pressure to develop new products for access and MAN markets that will enable carriers to leverage their current network infrastructure. 
 
To address these evolving requirements of the communications industry, OEMs must develop and introduce increasingly sophisticated systems with fewer engineering resources. To achieve the performance and functionality required of these systems, communications OEMs are using increasingly complex communications ICs, which now account for a significant portion of the value-added proprietary content of these systems. As a result of the need for new equipment introductions, the reduction in their technical staff, the proliferation of transmission standards, and the difficulty of designing and producing communications ICs, equipment suppliers are increasingly outsourcing the design and production of the ICs incorporated into their systems. 
 
These trends have created a significant opportunity for IC suppliers that can design cost-effective solutions for high-speed communications. The worldwide T/E carrier and related IC market is expected to grow over the next couple of years, with Salomon Smith Barney, or SSB, estimating that it will reach $922 million in potential revenue by 2004. In addition, SSB estimates that the SONET/SDH IC market will grow to $1 billion by 2004. 
 
The key ICs contained in a typical communications system include physical-interface, access control, network processor, traffic manager and switch fabric devices. The physical-interface device consists of a transmitter and receiver that, when integrated, is called a transceiver. Transceivers interface with the physical transmission media, such as copper wire or optical fiber. Most of these high-speed, mixed-signal ICs convert parallel digital inputs into a single analog bit stream that is up to 32 times faster than the original signal. Transceivers therefore serve as a bridge between analog transmission media and the digital devices that process data. Access control circuits are digital ICs that format, or frame, the data, perform error checking and in some applications aggregate signals by mapping multiple lower speed data streams to a single higher speed stream. The traffic manager manages the transfer of data between the network processor and the switch fabric, which work together to shape, route and control the data. 
 
Because physical-interface and access control ICs interface with the transmission media and are critical to increasing bandwidth, these ICs must offer high-speed and robust performance. Therefore, communications equipment OEMs seek IC suppliers that possess extensive analog and digital expertise to provide high-speed, mixed-signal solutions to bridge the analog physical world and the digital computing environment. This must be coupled with system-level expertise so that a supplier can quickly bring to market high-performance, highly reliable ICs with optimal feature sets.

Communications 
 
Exar’s products for T/E carrier, ATM and SONET/SDH applications include high-speed analog, digital and mixed-signal physical-interface and access control ICs. The physical-interface IC consists of a transmitter and receiver that, when integrated, is called a transceiver. Transceivers interface with the physical transmission media. Most of these high-speed, mixed-signal ICs convert parallel digital inputs into a single analog bit stream that is up to 32 times faster than the original signal. Access control circuits are digital circuits that format, or frame, the data, perform error checking and in some applications aggregate signals by mapping multiple lower speed data streams to a single higher speed stream. The figure below illustrates where the Company’s products are employed within networking equipment. 
 
Types of Communications ICs Used in Networking Equipment 
 
LOGO 
 
Exar’s communications products include transmitters and receivers, transceivers, jitter attenuators, framers, ATM UNIs (ATM User Network Interfaces) and data aggregation mappers. These products are used in networking equipment such as SONET/SDH multiplexers, private branch exchanges (PBX), central office switches, digital cross connects and multiservice provisioning platforms. The Company enhanced its physical-interface solution in 1999 with an integrated single chip transceiver. Subsequently, the Company announced two, three, four, six and twelve-channel versions of this transceiver that meet the same performance levels while requiring less board space and lower overall power in multi-port applications. In fiscal year 2001, the Company introduced its integrated, multi-channel jitter attenuator family, a proprietary solution that allows OEMs to meet difficult jitter transfer specifications while reducing overall system costs. Exar recently announced its next generation jitter attenuator capability, called “desynchronization,” which solves complex timing issues associated with mapping/demapping from SONET/SDH (synchronous) to T3/E3 (asynchronous) environments. The Company is embedding this new capability in its transceiver and data aggregation ICs. Exar’s access control products include framers, ATM UNIs and data aggregation mappers. These newer products are achieving greater market acceptance as Exar’s strong transceiver products have allowed it to compete for adjacent component opportunities. The Company also supplies a family of V.35 transceiver and multiprotocol products used for high-speed data transmission, primarily in networking equipment such as routers and bridges.

Video and Imaging 
 
The video market is composed of several segments, including digital still cameras, or DSCs, PC video cameras, security cameras, camcorders and digital camcorders. Among these applications, one of the fastest growing segments is DSCs. To create images that are more comparable to film cameras and include features such as steady-shot and digital zoom, DSCs and digital camcorders are requiring higher-resolution and higher-speed data acquisition subsystems, also known as analog front ends, or AFEs, and analog-to-digital converters, or ADCs. 
 
Exar supplies high-performance ADCs and integrated AFEs for products such as digital copiers, scanners or DSCs and multifunctional peripherals, or MFPs, which incorporate scanning, faxing and copying functions in a single integrated system. The Company uses advanced design techniques and process technologies to integrate low-power converter architectures with surrounding analog functions, thereby reducing system costs of the Company’s customers.

No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total sales during this period. Sales through the domestic distribution channel accounted for 27.6% of revenue. 
 
Manufacturing 
 
Exar outsources all of its fabrication and assembly, as well as the majority of its testing operations. This fabless manufacturing model allows the Company to focus on its core competencies of product design and development. 
 
The Company uses world-class independent wafer foundries, such as Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, or Chartered, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. Chartered and TSMC manufacture all of the Company’s CMOS products. Chartered manufactures all of the Company’s BiCMOS (which combines bipolar and CMOS processes) products. Rohm Co. Ltd., which manufactured all of the Company’s bipolar products, ceased operations in December 2001. The Company does not intend to use an alternative supplier. Accordingly, consignment inventory is being held to support end of life requirements of our customers for these products. The Company does not have long term supply agreements with Chartered or TSMC. The majority of the Company’s current products are implemented in standard CMOS. The Company uses CMOS manufacturing processes to take advantage of that technology’s lower power consumption, cost-effectiveness, foundry availability and ever-increasing speed. Currently, all of the Company’s new product development is being implemented in CMOS.             
 
Semiconductor wafers are usually shipped to the Company’s subcontractors in Asia for wafer test and assembly, where they are cut into individual dies and packaged. Independent contractors in Hong Kong, Indonesia and Singapore perform most of the Company’s assembly work. Following assembly, final test and quality assurance is performed either at the Company’s Fremont, California facility or at its subcontractors’ facilities in Asia. The Company conducts electrical testing of both wafers and packaged ICs. The combination of various functions makes the test process for analog and mixed-signal devices particularly difficult. Test operations require the programming, maintenance and use of sophisticated computer-based test systems and complex automatic handling systems.

Research and Development 
 
Exar believes that the continued introduction of new products in its target markets is essential to its growth. The Company is focused on developing solutions addressing the high-bandwidth requirements of communications systems OEMs. As of March 31, 2002, the Company’s research and development staff consisted of 142 employees, 61 of who hold advanced engineering degrees. Over the next year, Exar will continue to seek to hire strategic technical and marketing personnel. 
 
Competition 
 
The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and a history of price reductions as production efficiencies are achieved in successive generations of products. Although the market for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits is generally characterized by longer product life cycles and less dramatic price reductions than the market for digital integrated circuits, the Company faces substantial competition in each market in which it participates. Competition in the Company’s markets is based principally on technical innovation, product features, timely introduction of new products, quality and reliability, performance, price, technical support and service. The Company believes that it competes favorably in all of these areas. 
 
Because the IC markets are highly fragmented, the Company generally encounters different competitors in its various market areas. Competitors with respect to the Company’s communications products include Conexant Systems, Inc., PMC-Sierra and TranSwitch. In addition, the expansion of the Company’s communications product portfolio may in the future bring it into competition with other established communications IC companies, such as Applied Micro Circuits Corporation and Vitesse Semiconductor. Competitors in the Company’s other markets include Analog Devices Inc., Philips Electronics and Texas Instruments. 
 
Backlog 
 
Exar defines backlog to include OEM orders and distributor orders for which a delivery schedule has been specified for product shipment occurring primarily during the succeeding six months. 
 
At March 31, 2002, Exar’s backlog was $15.1 million, compared with $18.1 million at March 31, 2001. Exar believes that the decrease in the Company’s backlog was due to a reduction in carrier capital expenditures and inventory accumulation within the communications product market. Additionally, the decrease in the backlog resulted from the shortened order-to-shipment time of the Company’s products. Over the past 12 to 18 months, the Company has experienced increased percentage of orders received that shipped in the same quarter. If this practice of short order-to-delivery times continue, the Company’s backlog may be less than in previous years and not a reliable indicator of future revenue. 
 
Sales are made pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery of standard items or agreements covering purchases over a period of time, which are frequently subject to revision and cancellation. Lead times for the release of purchase orders depend on the scheduling practices of the individual customer and the rate of bookings varies from month to month. In addition, Exar’s distributor agreements generally permit the return of up to 10% of the purchases annually for purposes of stock rotation and also provide for credits to distributors in the event that Exar reduces the price of any product. Because of the possibility of changes in delivery schedules, quantities actually purchased, cancellations of orders, distributor returns or price reductions, Exar’s backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual sales for any succeeding six month period. Customers can cancel a significant portion, if not all, of their backlog at their discretion without substantial penalty.
