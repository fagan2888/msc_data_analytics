including mobile handsets, cable and satellite set-top boxes, personal computer modems, Voice over Internet Protocol on data networks, voice over digital subscriber line (DSL) modems, personal video recorders, telephone equipment and optical networking equipment.  With our acquisition of Cygnal Integrated Products, we now sell 8-bit microcontrollers (MCUs), which are incorporated in a broad range of applications in a variety of industries, including automotive, communications, consumer, industrial, medical and power management.  Our world-class, mixed-signal design engineers use standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, technology to create innovative ICs that can improve the performance and dramatically reduce the cost, size and system power requirements of devices that our customers sell to their end-user customers. Our expertise in analog-intensive, mixed-signal IC design in CMOS allows us to develop new and innovative products rapidly, which enables our customers to improve their time-to-market with end products that respond to their end customer demand.

 

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

 

In a January 2004 report, market research firm In-Stat projected that the analog IC market will grow by 29 percent to $36.4 billion in 2004. Recent growth in the market for ICs has been due to a number of factors, including the growth of Internet usage, development of new communications technologies, availability of improved communications services at lower costs, broad deployment of optical networks and remote access requirements for corporate networks. This demand has fueled tremendous growth in the number of electronic devices. For example, in mobile handset markets, the demand for wireless phones and other wireless devices, such as personal digital assistants, has grown steadily as digital wireless services have become increasingly popular and affordable. In other markets, demand has increased for a wide range of electronic products, including personal computers (PCs), cable and satellite set-top boxes, fax machines, credit card verification machines, automated teller machines, satellite radios and personal video recorders. Consumers increasingly demand higher capacity connections at their residences using cable modems or high speed DSL. Voice over Internet Protocol technology, which enables voice traffic over data networks is emerging as a viable alternative to traditional telephone networks.  The demand for greater and faster Internet access by households and businesses has increased the need to significantly upgrade the communications backbone to handle this traffic, increasing the need for smaller, faster and better performing optical networking systems that route this traffic.  In the 8-bit MCU and high performance analog market there is an increasing need for fully functional, analog intensive applications which are used in automotive, communications, consumer, industrial, medical and power management products.

 

Numerous devices require analog-intensive, mixed-signal circuits that provide analog-to-digital functionality. Traditional designs for electronic devices have used mixed-signal circuits built with numerous discrete analog and digital components. While these traditional designs provide the required functionality, they can be inefficient and inadequate for use in markets where size, cost, power consumption and performance are increasingly important product differentiators. In order to improve their competitive position, electronic device manufacturers need advanced mixed-signal ICs that reduce the number of discrete components and required board space to create smaller products with improved price/performance characteristics. Additionally, these manufacturers require programmable ICs that can be reconfigured to comply with numerous and constantly evolving international electronic standards without altering the fundamental design of a product.

 

Manufacturers of electronic devices face accelerating time-to-market demands and must adapt to evolving industry standards and new technologies.  Because analog-intensive, mixed-signal IC design expertise is difficult to find, these manufacturers increasingly are turning to third parties to provide advanced mixed-signal ICs. Designing the analog component of a mixed-signal IC involves great complexity and difficulty, because the performance of an analog IC depends on the creative analog expertise of engineers to optimize speed, power, amplitude and resolution within the constraints of standard manufacturing processes. The development of analog design expertise typically requires years of practical analog design experience under the guidance of a senior engineer, and engineers with the required level of skill and expertise are in short supply.

 

Many third-party IC providers lack sufficient analog expertise to develop compelling mixed-signal ICs. As a result, manufacturers of electronic devices are often faced with inadequate mixed-signal ICs and are challenged to find third-party providers that can supply them with mixed-signal ICs with greater functionality,

DSL Analog Front End
  
  
 
The DSL Analog Front End, or AFE, is designed to provide the connectivity functions for business or residential asymmetric digital subscriber line, or ADSL, connection at the user end in customer premises equipment. Such a connection addresses the business and residential demand for DSL broadband higher capacity connectivity as compared to traditional standard dial-up analog phone line transmission speeds. The DSL AFE supports several ADSL communication standards enabling various upload and download data rates.  When combined with our DAA products for analog phone line connectivity, our combined product offering provides a single modem design to address both the prevalent analog modem and the emerging ADSL services. The ability to dial up the analog phone line in order to provision the ADSL connection or run remote diagnostics can assist in the implementation and maintenance of this ADSL broadband connection.

SiPHY TM Optical Physical Layer Transceivers
  
  
 
We offer a family of high-speed physical layer ICs that meet the high-speed fiber Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) specifications. As part of this family we offer transceivers that operate at a rate of 2.5 Gbps (giga bits per second), a transmission speed commonly referred to as OC-48. The transceiver IC provides both the receive path deserialization and transmit path serialization as required by the SONET/SDH physical layer. We also offer a family of clock and data recovery chips to provide specific functions at multiple speeds up to the OC-48 rate. All of our physical layer products utilize our proprietary digital signal processing technology to reduce the device’s sensitivity to board-level noise and improve performance. This product is still in the early stages of customer adoption and has produced small amounts of revenue in certain product configurations.

Precision Clock Integrated Circuits
  
  
 
This precision clock product family includes various products ranging from general purpose clock multiplier products up to high performance multi-port, redundant, multiple frequency range clock multipliers and regenerators. SONET/SDH optical network systems require very high precision, low jitter, clock sources. Our knowledge gained in developing the physical layer transceiver subsections provided us the technology to offer these high performance clock products. Traditionally, these clock sources have been implemented using expensive, bulky modules, complicated discrete circuitry requiring numerous components, or hybrid IC/discrete solutions that offer limited functionality.  The frequency agility, performance, and integration offered by these devices are key design features for our customer base, especially as optical networking equipment transitions from OC-48 to higher speed OC-192 (10Gbpps).  This product is still in the early stages of customer adoption and has produced modest amounts of revenue in certain product configurations.

During fiscal year 2003, sales of our broad-based mixed-signal products and mobile handset products each accounted for approximately 50% of our revenues.  During fiscal year 2002, sales of our broad-based mixed-signal products and mobile handset products accounted for 63% and 37% of our revenues, respectively.  During fiscal year 2001, sales of our broad-based mixed-signal products and mobile handset products accounted for 81% and 19% of our revenues, respectively.

 

CUSTOMERS, SALES AND MARKETING

 

We market our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and other providers of applications in various markets through our direct sales staff, a network of independent sales representatives, and electronics distributors.  Direct and distributor customers buy on an individual purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term agreements.

 

We consider our customer to be the end customer purchasing either directly from a distributor, a contract manufacturer or us.  An end customer purchasing through a contract manufacturer typically instructs such contract manufacturer to obtain our products and incorporate such products with other components for sale by such contract manufacturer to the end customer.  Although we actually sell the products to, and are paid by, the distributors and contract manufacturers, we refer to such end customer as our customer.

 

One of our distributors, Edom Technology, selling to multiple end customers in Asia, represented 12.9% of our fiscal 2003 revenues.  Distributors are not considered end customers, but rather serve as a sales channel to our end customers.  No other distributor accounted for 10% or more of revenues for fiscal 2003.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

During fiscal 2003, our ten largest end customers accounted for 64% of our revenues.  We had one end customer, Samsung, which represented 21% of our revenues. No other single end customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. The following is a list of our largest end customers that purchased our products in fiscal 2003 for inclusion in products or devices offered to their customers:

 

•  Agere Systems

•  Broadcom

•  Conexant/PC-Tel

•  Echostar

•  Hughes

•  Sagem

•  Samsung

•  Sendo

•  Smart Link

•  Texas Instruments

•  Thomson

•  Wavecom

 

We maintain five sales offices in North America.  We provide European sales support through our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and France. The Asia Pacific area is supported through our subsidiaries in Japan and Hong Kong, as well as sales offices in Korea, Taiwan and China. Our direct sales force includes regional sales managers in the field and area business managers at our headquarters to further support customer communications. Many of these managers have engineering degrees. We maintain a dedicated website for our field sales organization, which includes technical documentation, backlog information, order status, product availability and new product introduction information to support our communications with that organization. Additionally, we provide direct communication to all field sales personnel as part of a structured sales communications program.

 

We also utilize independent sales representatives and distributors to generate sales of our products. We have relationships with many independent sales representatives and distributors worldwide whom we have selected based on their understanding of the mixed-signal IC marketplace and their ability to provide effective field sales applications support for our products. For the year ended January 3, 2004, sales through these representatives and distributors accounted for 27% of our sales.

 

Our marketing efforts are targeted at both identified industry leaders and emerging market participants. Direct marketing activities are supplemented by a focused marketing communications effort that seeks to raise awareness of the company and our products.  Our public relations efforts are focused on leading trade and business publications. Our external website is used to deliver corporate information and product information.  We also pursue targeted advertising in key trade publications and we have a cooperative marketing program that allows our distributors and representatives to promote our products to their local markets in conjunction with their own advertising activities.  Finally we maintain a presence at strategic trade shows and industry events. These activities, in combination with direct sales activities, help drive demand for our products.

 

Due to the complex and innovative nature of our ICs, we employ experienced applications engineers who work closely with customers to support the design-win process, and can significantly accelerate the customer’s time required to bring a product to market. A design-win occurs when a customer has designed our ICs into its product architecture. A considerable amount of effort to assist the customer in incorporating our ICs into its products is typically required prior to any sale. In many cases, our innovative ICs require significantly different implementations than existing approaches and, therefore, successful implementations may require extensive communication with potential customers. The amount of time required to achieve a design-win can vary substantially depending on a customer’s development cycle, which can be relatively short (such as three months) or very long (such as two years) based on a wide variety of customer factors. Due to this extensive design-win process, once a completed design architecture has been implemented and produced in high volumes, our customers are reluctant to significantly alter their designs. We believe this process, coupled with our intellectual property protection, promotes relatively longer product life cycles for our ICs and high barriers to entry for competitive products, even if such competing products are offered at lower prices. Finally, our close collaboration with our customers provides us with knowledge of derivative product ideas or completely new product line offerings that may not otherwise arise in other new product discussions.

 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

 

Through our research and development efforts, we apply our experienced analog and mixed-signal engineering talent and expertise to create new ICs that integrate functions typically performed inefficiently by multiple discrete components. This integration generally results in lower costs, smaller die sizes, lower power demands and enhanced price/performance characteristics. We attempt to reuse successful

 

8


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

techniques for integration in new applications where similar benefits can be realized.  We believe that reliable and precise analog and mixed-signal ICs can only be developed by teams of engineers that coordinate their efforts under the direction of senior engineers who have significant analog experience and are familiar with the intricacies of designing these ICs for commercial volume production. The development of test methodologies is a critical activity in releasing a new product for commercial success. We believe that we have attracted some of the best engineers in our industry. As of January 3, 2004, we had 188 employees involved in research and development.

 

Research and development expenses were $48.3 million, $32.0 million and $29.0 million in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

 

TECHNOLOGY

 

Our product development process facilitates the design of highly-innovative, analog-intensive, mixed-signal ICs. Our senior engineers start the product development process by forming an understanding of our customers’ products and then design alternatives with increased functionality and with decreasing power, size and cost requirements. Our engineers’ deep knowledge of existing and emerging standards and performance requirements help us to assess the technical feasibility of a particular IC. We target areas where we can provide compelling product improvements. Once we have solved the primary challenges, our field engineers continue to work closely with our customers’ design teams to maintain and develop an understanding of our customers’ needs, allowing us to formulate derivative products and refined features.

 

In providing mixed-signal ICs for our customers, we believe our key competitive advantages are:

 

•     analog CMOS design expertise;

 

•                  digital signal processing design expertise;

 

•                  microcontroller design expertise; and

 

•                  our broad understanding of systems technology and trends.

 

To fully capitalize on these advantages, we have assembled a world-class development team with exceptional analog and mixed-signal design expertise led by accomplished senior engineers.

 

ANALOG CMOS DESIGN EXPERTISE

 

We believe that our most significant core competency is our world-class analog design capability. Additionally, we strive to design all of our ICs in CMOS processes. There are several modern process technologies for manufacturing semiconductors including CMOS, Bipolar, BiCMOS, silicon germanium and gallium arsenide. While it is significantly more difficult to design analog ICs in CMOS, CMOS provides multiple benefits versus existing alternatives, including significantly reduced cost, reduced technology risk and greater worldwide foundry capacity. CMOS is the most commonly used process technology for manufacturing digital ICs and as a result is most likely to be used for the manufacturing of ICs with finer line geometries, which enable smaller and faster ICs. By designing our ICs in CMOS, we enable our products to benefit from this trend towards finer line geometries, which allows us to integrate more digital functionality into our mixed-signal ICs.

 

Designing analog ICs is significantly more complicated than designing digital ICs. While advanced software tools exist to help automate digital IC design, there are far fewer tools for advanced analog IC design. In many cases, our analog circuit design efforts begin at the fundamental transistor level. We believe that we have a demonstrated ability to design the most difficult analog and RF circuits using standard CMOS technologies. For example, our DAA product family replaces bulky, discrete modem components, such as transformers, relays and opto-isolators, with highly integrated CMOS mixed-signal ICs. Similarly, bulky wireless phone components such as voltage controlled oscillators are replaced by our integrated CMOS frequency synthesizer products. Our design expertise in the technically challenging optical networking market has allowed us to reduce the number of supplemental components

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

used in our customers’ products while providing lower levels of noise in the circuit operation.  This is a key technical consideration in high speed optical networks.

 

DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING DESIGN EXPERTISE

 

We consider the partitioning of a circuit’s functionality to be a proprietary and creative design technique. Our digital signal processing design expertise maximizes the price/performance characteristics of both the analog and digital functions and allows our ICs to work in an optimized manner to accomplish particular tasks. Generally, we surround core analog circuitry with digital CMOS transistors, which allows our ICs to perform the required analog functions with increased digital capabilities. For example, our ProSLIC product is designed to function more efficiently than traditional products for the source end of the telephone line, which involve a two chip combination requiring more board space and numerous external components. The ProSLIC product is partitioned by combining a core analog design that provides analog-to-digital conversion and digital-to-analog conversion with optimized digital signal processing functions such as data compression, data expansion, filtering and tone generation. In this manner, we can isolate the higher voltage required to ring a telephone in low-cost, off-chip high voltage transistors or a small, complementary high voltage chip, thereby enabling us to fulfill the remaining core functions with a single CMOS chip. As a further example, our SiPHY Optical Physical Layer Transceivers utilize an architecturally advanced phase locked loop circuit based principally on digital signal processing. By performing a significant portion of this function in the digital domain in a monolithic chip, the circuit has been able to satisfy the demanding specifications of the optical network SONET standard using inexpensive CMOS transistors.

 

MICROCONTROLLER DESIGN EXPERTISE

 

As a result of the acquisition of Cygnal Integrated Products, we now have the required engineering talent and circuit integration methodologies to combine precision analog, high-speed digital, Flash memory and in-system programmability into a single, monolithic CMOS integrated circuit. A microcontroller product is designed to capture an external analog signal, convert it to a digital signal, compute digital functions on the stream of data and then communicate the results through a standard digital interface. The ability to develop standard products with the broadest possible customer application base while being cost efficient with the silicon area of the monolithic CMOS integrated circuit requires a keen sense of customer value and engineering capabilities. Additionally, to manage the wide variety of signals on a monolithic piece of silicon including electrical noise, harmonics and other electronic distortions requires a fundamental knowledge of devices physics and accumulated design expertise.

 

UNDERSTANDING OF SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY AND TRENDS

 

Our focused expertise in mixed-signal ICs is the result of the breadth of engineering talent we have assembled with experience working in analog-intensive CMOS design for a wide variety of applications. This expertise, which we consider a competitive advantage, is the foundation of our in-depth understanding of the technology and trends that impact electronic systems and markets. Our expertise includes single line plain old telephone service (POTS), packet-based network interfaces and high speed SONET-based optical networks. We have also expanded our knowledge base into wireless technologies.  Our microcontroller applications broaden our knowledge base as we participate in these diverse markets.  Our understanding of the role of analog/digital interfaces within electronic systems and the key domestic and international telecommunications standards that must be supported are particular areas of our expertise.

 

MANUFACTURING

 

As a fabless IC manufacturer, we conduct IC design and development in our facilities in the United States and electronically transfer our proprietary IC designs to third-party semiconductor fabricators who process silicon wafers to produce the ICs that we design. Our IC designs use industry-standard CMOS manufacturing process technology to achieve a level of performance normally associated with more expensive special-purpose IC fabrication technology. We believe the use of CMOS technology facilitates the rapid production of our ICs within a lower cost framework. Our IC production employs submicron process geometries which are readily available from leading foundry suppliers worldwide, thus ensuring the availability of manufacturing capacity over our products’ life cycles.  We

 

10


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

currently rely principally on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor wafers. We believe that our fabless manufacturing model significantly reduces our capital requirements and allows us to focus our resources on design, development and marketing of our ICs.

 

Once the silicon wafers have been produced, they are shipped directly to our third-party assembly subcontractors. The assembled ICs are then forwarded for final testing, either to our facilities in Austin, Texas or to our third-party test subcontractors, prior to shipping to our customers. We have increasingly utilized offshore third-party test subcontractors, typically in Asia where the parts are assembled and where the products are frequently delivered to our customers.  During the fourth quarter of 2003, more than two-thirds of our units produced in volume were tested by offshore third-party test subcontractors.  We expect this trend toward utilization of offshore third-party test subcontractors to continue in fiscal 2004.

 

BACKLOG

 

As of January 3, 2004, our backlog was approximately $86.1 million, compared to approximately $46.0 million as of December 28, 2002.  We include in backlog accepted product purchase orders from customers and worldwide distributor stocking orders. We only include orders with an expected shipping date from us within six months.  Product orders in our backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or cancellation at the option of the purchaser typically without penalty. Our backlog may fluctuate significantly depending upon customer order patterns which may, in turn, vary considerably based on rapidly changing business circumstances. Backlog from distributors are not recognized as our revenues until the products are sold by the distributors. Additionally, our arrangements with distributors typically provide for price protection and stock rotation activities. Accordingly, we do not believe that our backlog at any time is necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period.

 

COMPETITION

 

The markets for semiconductors generally, and for analog and mixed-signal ICs in particular, are intensely competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry are:

 

•  Product size;

•  Level of integration;

•  Product capabilities;

•  Reliability;

•  Price;

•  Performance;

•  Intellectual property;

•  Customer support;

•  Reputation; and

•  Ability to rapidly introduce new products to market.

 

We believe that we are competitive with respect to these factors, particularly because our ICs typically are smaller in size, are highly integrated, achieve high performance specifications at lower price points than competitive products and are manufactured in standard CMOS which generally enables us to supply them on a relatively rapid basis to customers to meet their product introduction schedules. However, disadvantages we face include our relatively short operating history in certain of our markets and the need for customers to redesign their products and modify their software to implement our ICs in their products.

 

We anticipate that the market for our products will continually evolve and will be subject to rapid technological change. In addition, as we target and supply products to numerous markets and applications, we face competition from a relatively large number of competitors. Across our product offerings, we compete with Agere Systems, Atmel, AMCC, Analog Devices, Broadcom, Conexant, Cypress, ESS, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Infineon Technologies, Legerity, Maxim Integrated Products, Microchip, Motorola, National Semiconductor, Philips, RF Micro Devices, Semtech, Skyworks Solutions, Texas Instruments, Vitesse Semiconductor, and others. We expect to face competition in the future from our current competitors, other manufacturers and designers of semiconductors, and innovative start-up semiconductor design companies. Our competitors may also offer bundled chipset kit arrangements offering a more complete product, which may negatively impact our competitive position despite the technical merits or advantages of our products. In addition, our customers could develop products or technologies internally that would replace their need for our products and would become a source of competition. As the markets for electronic products grow, we also may face competition from traditional electronic

 

11


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

device companies.  These companies may enter the mixed-signal semiconductor market by introducing their own products, including components within their products that would eliminate the need for our ICs, or by entering into strategic relationships with or acquiring other existing IC providers.

 

Many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, access to larger customer bases, complementary product offerings, and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other resources than us. Current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial and strategic relationships between themselves or with our existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.

 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

 

Our future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. We seek to protect our technology through a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and confidentiality procedures. As of January 3, 2004, we had more than 300 issued or pending United States patents in the IC field. We also frequently file for patent protection in a variety of international jurisdictions with respect to the proprietary technology covered by our U.S. patents and patent applications. There can be no assurance that patents will ever be issued with respect to these applications. Furthermore, it is possible that any patents held by us may be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or licensed to others. In addition, there can be no assurance that such patents will provide us with competitive advantages or adequately safeguard our proprietary rights. The patents and patent applications described above will expire at various times in the distant future.

 

In addition, we claim copyright protection for proprietary documentation used in our products. We have filed for registration, or are in the process of filing for registration, of the visual image of each IC that we have manufactured in commercial quantities with the United States Copyright Office. We have registered the “Silicon Laboratories” logo and a variety of other product and product family names as trademarks in the United States and selected foreign jurisdictions. All other trademarks, service marks or trade names appearing in this report are the property of their respective owners. We also attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through other customary security measures. We intend to protect our rights vigorously, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. In addition, the laws of other countries in which our products are sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.

 

While our ability to effectively compete depends in large part on our ability to protect our intellectual property, we believe that our technical expertise and ability to introduce new products in a timely manner will be an important factor in maintaining our competitive position.

 

Many participants in the semiconductor and electronics industries have a significant number of patents and have frequently demonstrated a readiness to commence litigation based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement. From time to time, third parties may assert infringement claims against us. We may not prevail in any such litigation or may not be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Litigation, regardless of the outcome, is likely to result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources, including our management’s time. Any such litigation could materially adversely affect us. For further information regarding patent litigation, please see “Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”

 

Our licenses include industry standard licenses with our vendors, such as wafer fabrication tool libraries, third party core libraries, computer-aided design applications and business software applications.

 

EMPLOYEES

 

As of January 3, 2004, we employed 486 people, including 115 in manufacturing, 188 in research and development, 102 in marketing, 48 in sales and 33 in administration. Our success depends on the continued service of our key technical

 

12


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled analog and mixed-signal engineers.  The competition for such personnel is intense. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization. We consider our employee relations to be good.

 

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

 

Federal, state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the storage, use, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in the semiconductor industry.  Our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

 

FACTORS AFFECTING OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS

 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS

 

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR HISTORICAL GROWTH AND MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT PERIOD-TO-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN VOLATILITY IN OUR STOCK PRICE

 

Although we have experienced revenue growth in our eleven most recent quarterly periods, we may not be able to sustain this growth.  We may also experience significant period-to-period fluctuations in our revenues and operating results in the future due to a number of factors, and any such variations may cause our stock price to fluctuate.  It is likely that in some future period our revenues or operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors.  If this occurs, our stock price may drop, perhaps significantly.

 

A number of factors, in addition to those cited in other risk factors applicable to our business, may contribute to fluctuations in our revenues and operating results, including:

 

•     the timing and volume of orders received from our customers;

 

•                  the rate of acceptance of our products by our customers, including the acceptance of new products we may develop for integration in the products manufactured by such customers, which we refer to as “design wins”;

 

•     the time lag between “design wins” and production orders;

 

•     the demand for, and life cycles of, the products incorporating our ICs;

 

•     the rate of adoption of mixed-signal ICs in the markets we target;

 

•     deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements from us or our competitors or other providers of ICs;

 

•     changes in product mix;

 

•     the average selling prices for our products could drop suddenly due to competitive offerings or competitive predatory pricing;

 

•     impairment charges related to inventory, equipment or other long-lived assets;

 

•                  significant legal costs to defend our intellectual property rights or respond to claims against us; and

 

•                  the rate at which new markets emerge for products we are currently developing or for which our design expertise can be utilized to develop products for these new markets.

 

The markets for mobile handsets, personal computers, satellite television set-top boxes and voice over DSL applications are characterized by rapid fluctuations in demand and seasonality that result in corresponding fluctuations in the demand for our products that are incorporated in such devices.  Additionally, the rate of technology acceptance by our customers results in fluctuating demand for our products as customers are reluctant to incorporate a new IC into their products until the new IC has achieved market acceptance.  Once a new IC achieves market

 

13


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

acceptance, demand for the new IC can quickly accelerate to a point and then level off such that rapid historical growth in sales of a product should not be viewed as indicative of continued future growth.  In addition, demand can quickly decline for a product when a new IC product is introduced and receives market acceptance.  For example, transceivers that provide some of the functionality provided by our RF Synthesizers have been introduced to market by us and our competitors.  The introduction of these competing transceivers, including our Aero Transceiver, has resulted in a rapid decline in our sales of RF Synthesizers.  Due to the various factors mentioned above, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance.

 

WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUES, AND THE LOSS OF, OR A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ORDERS FROM, ANY KEY CUSTOMER COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES

 

The loss of any of our key customers, or a significant reduction in sales to any one of them, would significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business.  During the fiscal year ended January 3, 2004, our ten largest customers accounted for 64% of our revenues.  We had one customer, Samsung, which represented 21% of our revenues.  No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues during the fiscal year ended January 3, 2004.  Most of the markets for our products are dominated by a small number of potential customers.  Therefore, our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on our ability to sell to these dominant customers, as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our IC products.  In the future, these customers may decide not to purchase our ICs at all, purchase fewer ICs than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns, particularly because:

 

•                  we do not have any material long-term purchase arrangements with these or any of our other customers;

 

•                  substantially all of our sales to date have been made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;

 

•                  some of our customers may have efforts underway to actively diversify their vendor base which could reduce purchases of our ICs; and

 

•                  some of our customers have developed or acquired products that compete directly with products these customers purchase from us, which could affect our customers’ purchasing decisions in the future.

 

While we have been the sole supplier of the direct access arrangement, or DAA, ICs used in many of our customers’ soft modem DAA products and have also been a substantial supplier of synthesizers and transceivers to Samsung and other major GSM handset manufacturers, our customers regularly evaluate alternative sources of supply in order to diversify their supplier base, which would increase their negotiating leverage with us and protect their ability to secure these components.  We believe that any expansion of our customers’ supplier bases could have an adverse effect on the prices we are able to charge and volume of product that we are able to supply to our customers, which would negatively affect our revenues and operating results.

 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATING TO PRODUCT CONCENTRATION AND LACK OF REVENUE DIVERSIFICATION

 

We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term.  Continued market acceptance of these products, is therefore, critical to our future success.  In addition, substantially all of our products that we have sold include technology related to one or more of our issued U.S. patents.  If these patents are found to be invalid or unenforceable, our competitors could introduce competitive products that could reduce both the volume and price per unit of our products.  Our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by:

 

•                  a decline in demand for any of our more significant products, including our Aero Transceiver, RF Synthesizer, DAA, ISOmodem or ProSLIC;

 

14


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

•     failure of our products to achieve continued market acceptance;

 

•     an improved version of our products being offered by a competitor;

 

•     technological change that we are unable to address with our products; and

 

•     a failure to release new products or enhanced versions of our existing products on a timely basis and/or the failure of these products to achieve market acceptance.

 

We are particularly dependent on sales of our mobile handset products, which constituted 50% of our total revenues in fiscal 2003 and 37% of our total revenues in fiscal 2002.  In particular, one mobile handset product, our Aero Transceiver, represented approximately 40% of our total revenues in fiscal 2003.  If the market for the Aero Transceiver or the market for GSM mobile handsets in which these products are incorporated deteriorates, our operating results would be materially and adversely affected.

 

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE IN A TIMELY MANNER, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND COMPETITIVE POSITION COULD BE HARMED

 

Our future success will depend on our ability to reduce our dependence on a few products by developing new ICs and product enhancements that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner.  The development of mixed-signal ICs is highly complex, and we occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements.  Successful product development and market acceptance of our products depend on a number of factors, including:

 

•     changing requirements of customers;

 

•                  accurate prediction of market requirements;

 

•                  timely completion and introduction of new designs;

 

•                  timely qualification and certification of our ICs for use in our customers’ products;

 

•                  commercial acceptance and volume production of the products into which our ICs will be incorporated;

 

•                  availability of foundry, assembly and test capacity;

 

•                  achievement of high manufacturing yields;

 

•                  quality, price, performance, power use and size of our products;

 

•                  availability, quality, price and performance of competing products and technologies;

 

•                  our customer service and support capabilities and responsiveness;

 

•                  successful development of our relationships with existing and potential customers;

 

•                  changes in technology, industry standards or end-user preferences; and

 

•                  cooperation of software partners and semiconductor partners to support our chips within a system.

 

We cannot provide any assurance that products which we recently have developed or may develop in the future will achieve market acceptance.  We have introduced to market or are in development of many ICs.  If our ICs fail to achieve market acceptance, or if we fail to develop new products that achieve market acceptance, our growth prospects, operating results and competitive position could be adversely affected.

 

OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS, AND ANY DELAY IN THE DEVELOPMENT, OR ABANDONMENT, OF

 

15


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

THESE TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS BY INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, OR THEIR FAILURE TO ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE, COULD COMPROMISE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION

 

Our ICs are used as components in electronic devices in various markets.  As a result, we have devoted and expect to continue to devote a large amount of resources to develop products based on new and emerging technologies and standards that will be commercially introduced in the future.  Research and development expense for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2004 was $48.3 million, or 14.8% of revenues.  A number of large companies are actively involved in the development of these new technologies and standards.  Should any of these companies delay or abandon their efforts to develop commercially available products based on new technologies and standards, our research and development efforts with respect to these technologies and standards likely would have no appreciable value.  In addition, if we do not correctly anticipate new technologies and standards, or if the products that we develop based on these new technologies and standards fail to achieve market acceptance, our competitors may be better able to address market demand than we would.  Furthermore, if markets for these new technologies and standards develop later than we anticipate, or do not develop at all, demand for our products that are currently in development would suffer, resulting in lower sales of these products than we currently anticipate.  For example, we have introduced to market the Aero Transceiver product for use in wireless phones operating on the GSM standard.  We cannot be certain that this standard will not change, thereby making our products unsuitable or impractical.  Our MCU products are based on an 8-bit processor architecture. Should customers decide they need a higher performance 16-bit processor, then our products would be unsuitable and we would not realize sales from that opportunity.

 

OUR INABILITY TO MANAGE GROWTH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS

 

In recent periods, we have significantly increased the scope of our operations and expanded our workforce from 279 employees at the end of fiscal 2001 to 486 employees at the end of fiscal 2003.  In December 2003, we added 60 employees with the acquisition of Cygnal.  This growth has placed, and any future growth of our operations will continue to place, a significant strain on our management personnel, systems and resources.  We anticipate that we will need to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems, information technology infrastructure, procedures and controls, including the improvement of our accounting and other internal management systems to manage this growth and comply with regulatory guidelines.  We also expect that we will need to continue to expand, train, manage and motivate our workforce.  All of these endeavors will require substantial management effort, and we anticipate that we will require additional management personnel and internal processes to manage these efforts and to plan for the succession from time to time of certain persons who have been key management and technical personnel.  If we are unable to effectively manage our expanding global operations, our business could be materially and adversely affected.

 

WE RELY ON THIRD PARTIES TO MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLE AND TEST OUR PRODUCTS AND THE FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR MANUFACTURERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS

 

We do not have our own wafer fab manufacturing facilities.  Therefore, we rely principally on one third-party vendor, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), to manufacture the ICs we design.  We also currently rely principally on two offshore third-party assembly subcontractors, Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) and Amkor Technology, to assemble and package the silicon chips provided by the wafers for use in final products.  Additionally, we rely on these offshore subcontractors for a significant portion of the testing requirements of our products prior to shipping.  Although we also maintain testing facilities in Austin, Texas, we have increasingly utilized offshore third-party test subcontractors, typically in Asia, where the parts are assembled and where the products are more frequently delivered to our customers.  We expect this trend toward utilization of offshore third-party test subcontractors to continue.

 

There are significant risks associated with relying on these third-party foundries and subcontractors, including:

 

•                  failure by us, our customers or their end customers to qualify a selected supplier;

 

•                  capacity shortages during periods of high demand;

 

16


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

•                  potential insolvency of the third-party subcontractors;

 

•                  reduced control over delivery schedules and quality;

 

•                  limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us;

 

•                  potential increases in prices;

 

•                  increased need for international-based supply, logistics and financial management;

 

•                  their inability to supply or support new or changing packaging technologies; and

 

•                  low test yields.

 

We have supply contracts with our third-party vendors which obligate the vendor to perform services and supply products to us for a specific period, in specific quantities, and at specific prices.  We are not obligated to any fixed fee or minimum purchase obligations.  In the event that these vendors failed to meet our demand for whatever reason, we believe that other semiconductor foundries or assembly or test subcontractors could adequately address our needs.  However, we expect that it would take up to twelve months to transition performance of these services from our current providers to new providers.  Such a transition may also require a qualification process by our customers or their end customers.  We generally place orders for products with our foundry approximately three months prior to the anticipated delivery date, with order volumes based on our forecasts of demand from our customers.  Accordingly, if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products, we may be unable to obtain adequate foundry or assembly capacity from our third-party foundry and assembly subcontractors to meet our customers’ delivery requirements, or we may accumulate excess inventories.  On occasion, we have been unable to adequately respond to unexpected increases in customer purchase orders, and, therefore, were unable to benefit from this incremental demand.  Beyond our current forecast, our third-party foundry or assembly or test subcontractors typically do not provide guarantees to us that adequate capacity will be available to us within the time required to meet additional demand for our products.

 

Since our inception, substantially all of the silicon wafers for the products that we have shipped were manufactured either by TSMC or its affiliates.  Our customers typically complete their own qualification process.  If we fail to properly balance customer demand across the existing semiconductor fabrication facilities that we utilize or are required by our foundry partners to increase, or otherwise change the number of fab lines that we utilize for our production, we might not be able to fulfill demand for our products and may need to divert our engineering resources away from new product development initiatives to support the fab line transition, which would adversely affect our operating results.  Additionally, a resulting write-off of unusable or excess inventories would contribute to a decline in earnings.

 

WE HAVE INCREASED OUR INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES SIGNIFICANTLY AND PLAN TO CONTINUE SUCH EFFORTS, WHICH SUBJECTS US TO ADDITIONAL BUSINESS RISKS INCLUDING INCREASED LOGISTICAL AND FINANCIAL COMPLEXITY, POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS

 

We recently established additional international subsidiaries and have opened additional offices in international markets to expand our international activities in Europe and the Pacific Rim region.  The percentage of our revenues to customers located outside of the United States was 80% in fiscal 2003, 79% in fiscal 2002 and 66% in fiscal 2001.  We may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products.  Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:

 

•                  increased complexity and costs of managing international operations;

 

•                  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competition in some countries;

 

•                  multiple, conflicting and changing laws, regulations and tax schemes;

 

•                  longer sales cycles;

 

17


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

•                  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;

 

•                  high levels of distributor inventory subject to rights of return to us;

 

•                  political and economic instability; and

 

•                  greater difficulty in hiring qualified technical sales and applications engineers.

 

To date, all of our sales to international customers and purchases of components from international suppliers have been denominated in U.S. dollars.  As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive for our international customers to purchase, thus rendering our products less competitive.

 

MOST OF OUR CURRENT MANUFACTURERS, ASSEMBLERS, TEST SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND CUSTOMERS ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK THAT A NATURAL DISASTER, EPIDEMIC, LABOR STRIKE, WAR OR POLITICAL UNREST COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS OR SALES

 

Most of our current semiconductor wafer manufacturer’s foundries and one of our assembly and test subcontractor’s sites are primarily located in the same region within Taiwan and our other assembly and test subcontractors are located in the Pacific Rim region.  In addition, many of our customers, particularly mobile handset manufacturers, are located in the Pacific Rim region.  The risk of earthquakes in Taiwan and the Pacific Rim region is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines in the area.  We are not currently covered by insurance against business disruption caused by earthquakes as such insurance is not currently available on terms that we believe are commercially reasonable.  Earthquakes, fire, flooding, lack of water or other natural disasters in Taiwan or the Pacific Rim region, or an epidemic, political unrest, war, labor strikes or work stoppages in countries where our semiconductor manufacturer, assemblers and test subcontractors are located, likely would result in the disruption of our foundry, assembly or test capacity.  There can be no assurance that such alternate capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.

 

A natural disaster, epidemic, labor strike, war or political unrest where our customers’ facilities are located would likely reduce our sales to such customers.  For example, Samsung, our largest customer, is based in South Korea and represented 21% of our revenues in fiscal 2003.  North Korea’s recent decision to withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and related geopolitical maneuverings have created unrest.  Such unrest could create economic uncertainty or instability, could escalate to war or otherwise adversely affect South Korea and our South Korean customers and reduce our sales to such customers, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results.  In addition, a significant portion of the assembly and testing of our mobile handset products occurs in South Korea.  Any disruption resulting from these events could also cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing, assembling or testing from the affected subcontractor to another third-party vendor.

 

THE SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING PROCESS IS HIGHLY COMPLEX AND, FROM TIME TO TIME, MANUFACTURING YIELDS MAY FALL BELOW OUR EXPECTATIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN OUR INABILITY TO SATISFY DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER

 

The manufacture of our products is a highly complex and technologically demanding process.  This is particularly the case when multiple chips are packaged in a multi-chip module, such as the Aero I/I+ Transceiver.  Although we work closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields, our foundries from time to time have experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields.  Changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by our foundries could result in lower than anticipated manufacturing yields or unacceptable performance deficiencies.  If our foundries fail to deliver fabricated silicon wafers of satisfactory quality in a timely manner, we will be unable to meet our customers’ demand for our products in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships.

 

18


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

OUR PRODUCTS ARE COMPLEX AND MAY REQUIRE MODIFICATIONS TO RESOLVE UNDETECTED ERRORS WHICH COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN OUR COSTS OR A REDUCTION IN OUR REVENUES

 

Our products are complex and may contain errors when first introduced or as new versions are released.  We rely primarily on our in-house testing personnel to design test operations and procedures to detect any errors prior to delivery of our products to our customers.  Because our products are manufactured by third parties, should problems occur in the operation or performance of our ICs, we may experience delays in meeting key introduction dates or scheduled delivery dates to our customers.  These errors also could cause us to incur significant re-engineering costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations and business reputation problems.

 

WE DEPEND ON OUR KEY PERSONNEL TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS EFFECTIVELY IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING MARKET, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN OUR CURRENT PERSONNEL AND HIRE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL, OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND SUCCESSFULLY MARKET OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE HARMED

 

We believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, engineering, sales and marketing personnel.  We believe that our future success will be dependent on retaining the services of our key personnel, developing their successors and certain internal processes to reduce our reliance on specific individuals, and on properly managing the transition of key roles when they occur.  For example, at the beginning of fiscal 2004, Navdeep Sooch, our co-founder and chairman of the board, transitioned out of his role as CEO and Daniel Artusi, our Chief Operating Officer and President, assumed the role of CEO.  There is currently a shortage of qualified personnel with significant experience in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of analog and mixed-signal ICs.  In particular, there is a shortage of engineers who are familiar with the intricacies of the design and manufacturability of analog elements, and competition for such personnel is intense.  Our key technical personnel represent a significant asset and serve as the primary source for our technological and product innovations.  We may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of technical personnel to support our anticipated growth.  The loss of any of our key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel both in the United States and internationally, including engineers and sales and marketing personnel, could delay the development and introduction of, and negatively impact our ability to sell, our products.

 

ANY ACQUISITIONS WE MAKE COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS AND HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION

 

On December 10, 2003, we acquired Cygnal.  As part of our growth and product diversification strategy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire other businesses, intellectual property or technologies that would complement our current offerings, expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities.  The Cygnal acquisition and other acquisitions that we may potentially make in the future entail a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, including:

 

•                  problems integrating the acquired operations, technologies or products with our existing business and products;

 

•                  diversion of management’s time and attention from our core business;

 

•                  need for financial resources above our planned investment levels;

 

•                  difficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired company;

 

•                  risks associated with entering markets in which we lack prior experience;

 

•                  potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; and

 

•                  potential impairment of related goodwill and intangible assets.

 

In connection with the Cygnal acquisition, we are obligated to issue up to 1,290,963 shares of our common stock based upon the achievement of Cygnal product revenue milestones, which could distract our management and employees and lead to disputes with former Cygnal stockholders.  Future acquisitions also could cause us

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

to incur debt or contingent liabilities or cause us to issue equity securities that could negatively impact the ownership percentages of existing shareholders.

 

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE

 

Our products rely on our proprietary technology, and we expect that future technological advances made by us will be critical to sustain market acceptance of our products.  Therefore, we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is and will continue to be important to the success of our business.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights.  We also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, intellectual property providers and business partners, and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information.  Despite these efforts, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology.  Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.  We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of our pending applications nor can we be certain that any issued patents would protect or benefit us or give us adequate protection from competing products.  For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged and declared invalid or unenforceable.  We also cannot be certain that others will not develop effective competing technologies on their own.

 

SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION OVER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN OUR INDUSTRY MAY CAUSE US TO BECOME INVOLVED IN COSTLY AND LENGTHY LITIGATION WHICH COULD SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BUSINESS

 

In recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights.  From time to time, we receive letters from various industry participants alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or misappropriation of trade secrets or from customers requesting indemnification for claims brought against them by third parties.  The exploratory nature of these inquiries has become relatively common in the semiconductor industry.  We typically respond when appropriate and as advised by legal counsel.  We have been involved in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights in the past and may become involved in such litigation again in the future.  For example, in April 2003, we paid $17 million to settle patent infringement claims brought against us by TDK Semiconductor Corporation.  In January 2004, Digcom commenced a lawsuit against us and several other major companies in the GSM/GPRS wireless market for alleged past infringement of one of their expired patents.  In the future, we may become involved in additional litigation to defend allegations of infringement asserted by others, both directly and indirectly as a result of certain industry-standard indemnities we may offer to our customers.  Legal proceedings could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our proprietary rights.  Legal proceedings initiated by us to protect our intellectual property rights could also result in counterclaims or countersuits against us.  Any litigation, regardless of its outcome, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert our management’s time and attention.  Most intellectual property litigation also could force us to take specific actions, including:

 

•                  cease selling products that use the challenged intellectual property;

 

•                  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property a right to a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;

 

•                  redesign those products that use infringing intellectual property; or

 

•                  pursue legal remedies with third parties to enforce our indemnification rights, which may not adequately protect our interests.

 

FAILURE TO MANAGE OUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL RELATIONSHIPS COULD IMPEDE OUR FUTURE GROWTH

 

The future growth of our business will depend in part on our ability to manage our relationships with current and future distributors and sales representatives, develop additional channels for the distribution and sale of our products and manage

 

20


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

these relationships.  As we execute our indirect sales strategy, we will need to manage the potential conflicts that may arise with our direct sales efforts.  For example, conflicts with a distributor may arise when a customer begins purchasing directly from us rather than through the distributor.  The inability to successfully execute or manage a multi-channel sales strategy could impede our future growth.

 

WE COULD SEEK TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES, BUT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL

 

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements and commitments for at least the next 12 months.  However, it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities or to facilitate acquisitions of other businesses, products or technologies.  We believe we could raise these funds, if needed, by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors.  In addition, even though we may not need additional funds, we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons.  However, we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms, or at all.  If we decide to raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced.

 

OUR CUSTOMERS REQUIRE OUR PRODUCTS TO UNDERGO A LENGTHY AND EXPENSIVE QUALIFICATION PROCESS WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCE OF PRODUCT SALES

 

Prior to purchasing our products, our customers require that our products undergo an extensive qualification process, which involves testing of the products in the customer’s system as well as rigorous reliability testing.  This qualification process may continue for six months or longer.  However, qualification of a product by a customer does not ensure any sales of the product to that customer.  Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to the IC, changes in its manufacturing process or the selection of a new supplier by us may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory.  After our products are qualified, it can take an additional six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products.  Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, toward qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales.  If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, such failure or delay would preclude or delay sales of such product to the customer, which may impede our growth and cause our business to suffer.

 

WE DEPEND ON OUR CUSTOMERS TO SUPPORT OUR PRODUCTS, AND SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS OFFER COMPETING PRODUCTS

 

Our products are currently used by our customers to produce modems, telephony equipment, mobile handsets, optical networking equipment and a broad range of other devices.  We rely on our customers to provide hardware, software, intellectual property indemnification and other technical support for the products supplied by our customers.  If our customers do not provide the required functionality or if our customers do not provide satisfactory support for their products, the demand for these devices that incorporate our products may diminish or we may otherwise be materially adversely affected.  Any reduction in the demand for these devices would significantly reduce our revenues.

 

In certain products such as the DAA, some of our customers (including Conexant and Smart Link) offer their own competitive products.  These customers may find it advantageous to support their own offerings in the marketplace in lieu of promoting our products.

 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASED INVENTORY RISKS AND COSTS BECAUSE WE BUILD OUR PRODUCTS BASED ON FORECASTS PROVIDED BY CUSTOMERS BEFORE RECEIVING PURCHASE ORDERS FOR THE PRODUCTS

 

In order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest customers, we start the manufacturing of our products in advance of receiving purchase orders based on forecasts provided by these customers.  However, these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments and we do not recognize sales for these products until they are shipped to the customer.  As a result, we

 

21


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales.  Because demand for our products may not materialize, manufacturing based on forecasts subjects us to increased risks of high inventory carrying costs and increased obsolescence and may increase our operating costs.  These inventory risks are exacerbated when our customers purchase indirectly through contract manufacturers because this causes us to have less visibility regarding the accumulated levels of inventory for such customers.

 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISKS RELATED TO OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ESPECIALLY WHEN OVERSEAS CUSTOMERS PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS

 

We do not generally obtain letters of credit or other security for payment from customers, distributors or contract manufacturers.  Accordingly, we are not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these entities.  If we are unable to collect our accounts receivable, our operating results could be materially harmed.  We continue to monitor the credit worthiness and payment practice of each of our customers, distributors and contract manufacturers, and to date have not had any significant write-offs of receivable balances from them.

 

WE ARE A RELATIVELY SMALL COMPANY WITH LIMITED RESOURCES COMPARED TO SOME OF OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AND INCREASE MARKET SHARE

 

Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources and name recognition and a larger base of customers than we have.  As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers.  They also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours.  In addition, some of our current and potential competitors have already established supplier or joint development relationships with the decision makers at our current or potential customers.  These competitors may be able to leverage their existing relationships to discourage their customers from purchasing products from us or persuade them to replace our products with their products.  Our competitors may also offer bundled chipset kit arrangements offering a more complete product despite the technical merits or advantages of our products.  These competitors may elect not to support our products which could complicate our sales efforts.  These and other competitive pressures may prevent us from competing successfully against current or future competitors, and may materially harm our business.  Competition could decrease our prices, reduce our sales, lower our gross profits or decrease our market share.

 

OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE

 

The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future.  The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors:

 

•     actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

 

•     changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates;

 

•     changes in market valuations of other technology companies, particularly semiconductor companies;

 

•     announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;

 

•     introduction of technologies or product enhancements that reduce the need for our products;

 

•     the loss of one or more key original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers;

 

•     dilution from the issuance of our stock in connection with acquisitions; and

 

•     departures of key personnel.

 

The stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies.  These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our performance.

 

22


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

PROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE LAW COULD PREVENT, DELAY OR IMPEDE A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF US AND MAY REDUCE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK

 

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable.  For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for:

 

•                  the division of our board of directors into three classes to be elected on a staggered basis, one class each year;

 

•     the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of our preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of our stockholders;

 

•     a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent;

 

•     elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;

 

•     a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders; and

 

•                  a requirement that a supermajority vote be obtained to amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.

 

We also are subject to the anti-takeover laws of Delaware which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

 

THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR DSL ANALOG FRONT END (AFE) AND MODEM RELATED PRODUCTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SEVERE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT MAY REQUIRE MODIFICATIONS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN OUR COSTS OR A REDUCTION IN OUR REVENUES

 

Although our DSL AFE and modem related products are compliant with published specifications, these established specifications might not adequately address all conditions that must be satisfied in order to operate in harsh environments.  This includes environments where there are wide variations in electrical quality, telephone line quality, static electricity and operating temperatures or that may be affected by lightning or improper handling by customers and end users.  These environmental factors may result in unanticipated returns of our products.  Any necessary modifications could cause us to incur significant re-engineering costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations and business reputation problems.

 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY

 

COMPETITION WITHIN THE NUMEROUS MARKETS WE TARGET MAY REDUCE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND REDUCE MARKET SHARE

 

The markets for semiconductors in general, and for mixed-signal ICs in particular, are intensely competitive.  We expect that the market for our products will continually evolve and will be subject to rapid technological change.  In addition, as we target and supply products to numerous markets and applications, we face competition from a relatively large number of competitors.  Across all of our product areas, we compete with Agere Systems, Atmel, AMCC, Analog Devices, Broadcom, Conexant, Cypress, ESS, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Infineon Technologies, Legerity, Maxim Integrated Products, Microchip, Motorola, National Semiconductor, Philips, RF Micro Devices, Semtech, Skyworks Solutions Inc., Texas Instruments, Vitesse Semiconductor and others.  We expect to face competition in the future from our current competitors, other manufacturers and designers of semiconductors, and start-up semiconductor design companies.  Some of our customers, such as Agere Systems, Broadcom, Intel, Motorola, Samsung and Texas Instruments, are also large, established semiconductor suppliers.  Our sales to and support of these customers may enable them to become a source of competition to us, despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights.  As the markets for communications products grow, we also may face competition from traditional communications device companies.  These companies may enter the mixed-signal semiconductor market by

 

23


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

introducing their own ICs or by entering into strategic relationships with or acquiring other existing providers of semiconductor products.

 

In addition, large companies may restructure their operations to create separate companies or may acquire new businesses that are focused on providing the types of products we produce or acquire our customers.  For example, in May 2003, Conexant acquired PC-Tel’s modem business.  In the future, Conexant may seek to supplant our silicon DAA products that have historically been incorporated in PC-Tel’s products with Conexant’s own competing DAA product.  As an additional example, in October 2003, Motorola announced it would separate its semiconductor operations into a publicly traded company focused on communications and integrated electronic systems.  Also, in November 2003, Conexant and GlobespanVirata announced a plan to merge that will focus the combined company on all broadband applications.

 

THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD DECREASE RAPIDLY WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS

 

We may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices.  We have reduced the average unit price of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors.  The highly competitive GSM handset market is extremely cost sensitive due to the potentially very high volumes and stringent expectations placed on consumer electronics component suppliers for aggressive and sustained price reductions which do result in declining average selling prices.  We expect that these factors will create downward pressure on our average selling prices and gross profit percentages.  If we are unable to offset any such reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes and corresponding production cost reductions, our gross profits and revenues will suffer.  To maintain our gross profit percentage, we will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our costs.  Our failure to do so would cause our revenues and gross profit percentage to decline.

 

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY, WHICH HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURNS

 

The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand.  The industry has experienced significant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both semiconductor companies’ and their customers’ products and declines in general economic conditions.  These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices.  Specific areas of the communications markets have contributed to the overall decline and volatility of the semiconductor industry in the recent past.  For example, in fiscal 2001, the semiconductor industry suffered a downturn due to reductions in the actual unit sales of personal computers and wireless phones as compared to previous robust forecasts.  Additionally, changing and competing technical standards in airwave interfaces such as GSM and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) for mobile handsets, migration to higher speed communication protocols in the optical space and the return to prominence of the traditional regional Bell operating companies compared to the competitive local exchange companies all contributed to the volatility in the communications area of the semiconductor industry.  This downturn resulted in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in fiscal 2001.

 

Due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, an upturn in business could result in increased competition for access to third-party foundry, assembly and test capacity.  We are dependent on the availability of such capacity to manufacture, assemble and test our ICs.  None of our third-party foundry, assembly or test subcontractors have provided assurances that adequate capacity will be available to us.

 

OUR PRODUCTS MUST CONFORM TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS IN ORDER TO BE ACCEPTED BY END USERS IN OUR MARKETS

 

Generally, our products comprise only a part of a device.  All components of such devices must uniformly comply with industry standards in order to operate efficiently together.  We depend on companies that provide other components of the

 

24


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

devices to support prevailing industry standards.  Many of these companies are significantly larger and more influential in affecting industry standards than we are.  Some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly, and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our customers or end users.  If larger companies do not support the same industry standards that we do, or if competing standards emerge, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected which would harm our business.

 

Products for communications applications are based on industry standards that are continually evolving.  For example, GSM mobile handsets now commonly use the GPRS specification for enabling data communications.  Certain suppliers are now offering mobile handsets utilizing the Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE) protocol to support higher data communication rates on GSM networks.  Our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards.  The emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by other suppliers.  As a result, we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards.  If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins.  We may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance.  Our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense.
