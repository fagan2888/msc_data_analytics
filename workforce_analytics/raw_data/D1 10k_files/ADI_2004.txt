Industry Background 

      All electronic signals fall into one of two categories, analog or digital. Analog, also known as linear, signals represent real-world phenomena, such as temperature, pressure, sound, speed and motion. This information can be detected and measured using analog sensors, which represent real-world phenomena by generating continuously-varying voltages and currents. The signals from these sensors are initially processed using analog methods, such as amplification, filtering and shaping. They are then usually converted to digital form for storage or further manipulation. The further manipulation of the signals after conversion to digital form is called “digital signal processing.” Digital signals represent the “ones” and “zeros” of binary arithmetic and are either on or off. Digital signals are frequently converted back to analog form for functions such as video display, audio output or control. These manipulations and transformations from analog to digital and back to analog are known as “real-world signal processing” within the signal chain. 

      Significant advances in semiconductor technology in recent years have substantially increased the performance and functionality of integrated circuits, or ICs, used in signal processing applications. These advances include the ability to combine analog and digital signal processing capability on a single chip, thereby making possible more highly-integrated solutions. The widespread application of low-cost microprocessor-based systems and of digital communication technologies has increased the need for signal conditioning interfaces between the analog and digital world. At the same time, the convergence of computing and communications has resulted in end products that incorporate state-of-the-art signal processing capability onto as few chips as possible. Our products are designed to be used within electronic equipment to achieve higher performance, including greater speed, improved accuracy, more efficient signal processing and minimized power consumption. 

Principal Products 

      We design, manufacture and market a broad line of high-performance ICs that incorporate analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing technologies. Our ICs are designed to address a wide range of real-world signal processing applications. Across the entire range of our signal processing ICs are both general purpose products used by a broad range of customers and applications as well as application-specific products designed for specific clusters of customers in vertical markets. By using readily available, high-performance, general-purpose products in their systems, our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market. Given the high cost of developing customized ICs, our standard products often provide the most cost-effective solution for many low to medium volume applications. In some communications, computer and consumer products, we focus on working with leading customers to design application-specific solutions. We begin with our existing core technologies in analog and DSP, and devise a solution to more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers. Because we have already developed the core technology for our general-purpose products, we can create application-specific solutions quickly. 

      We produce and market several thousand products. Our ten highest revenue products accounted for approximately 17% of our revenue for fiscal 2004. The majority of our products are proprietary, meaning equivalent products are not available from competitors. A limited number of other companies may provide products with similar functions. 

 
  
 Analog Products 

      Our analog IC technology has been the foundation of our business for nearly four decades, and we believe we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of analog ICs. Our analog ICs are primarily high-performance devices, generally defined as devices that support a minimum of 10-bits of accuracy and a minimum of 50 megahertz of speed. The principal advantages these applications have versus competitors’ products include higher accuracy, lower cost per function, smaller size, lower power consumption and fewer components for improved reliability. The majority of our analog IC product revenue is attributable to sales of data converters and amplifiers. The data converter and amplifier product categories represented approximately 60% of our fiscal 2004 revenue. Other analog IC products include analog signal processing devices such as analog multipliers, switches, multiplexers and comparators. Over the past several years we have been expanding our

Table of Contents

analog IC product offerings along the entire analog signal chain and into product areas such as radio frequency integrated circuits, or RF ICs, and power management products such as voltage regulators and thermal monitoring ICs. 
      The majority of our analog IC products are proprietary to us in their design and general purpose in their application. This allows customers to incorporate our products into a wide variety of electronic equipment and systems. Our product portfolio includes several thousand analog ICs, any one of which can have as many as several hundred customers. Our analog ICs typically have long product life cycles. Our analog IC customers include both original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and customers who build electronic subsystems for integration into larger systems. 

      Our analog technology base also includes products using an advanced IC technology known in the industry as surface micromachining, which is used to produce semiconductor products known as micro-electromechanical systems, or MEMS. This technology enables extremely small mechanical sensors to be built on the surface of a chip along with supporting circuitry. In addition to incorporating an electro-mechanical structure, these devices also have analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element. The integration of signal conditioning and MEMS is a unique feature of our products which we call iMEMS®. Our iMEMS product portfolio includes accelerometers used to sense acceleration, and gyroscopes used to sense position. The majority of our current revenue from micromachined products is derived from accelerometers used by automotive manufacturers in airbag applications. However, revenue from consumer and industrial customers is increasing as we develop products using this technology for applications in these end markets. 

 
  
 DSP Products 

      DSPs are processors that are optimized for high-speed numeric calculations, which are essential for real-time processing of digital data resulting from analog to digital signal conversion. Our DSP products are designed to be fully programmable and to efficiently execute specialized software programs, or algorithms, associated with processing digitized real-time, real-world data. Programmable DSPs provide the flexibility to modify the device’s function quickly and inexpensively in software. We offer both general-purpose and application-specific DSP products. General-purpose DSP IC customers typically write their own algorithms using software tools that we provide and software tools they obtain from third-party suppliers. Our application-specific DSP products typically include analog and DSP technology and the DSPs are preprogrammed to execute software for applications such as wireless telecommunications or image processing. Our DSPs are designed in families of products that share a common architecture and therefore can execute the same software. We support these products with specialized applications and easy-to-use, low-cost development tools, which reduce our customers’ product development costs and time-to-market. 

      Increasingly, many of our products combine analog and digital signal processing technology into multi-function mixed-signal devices and chipsets. The growing technological demands associated with the use of audio and video in computers and consumer products as well as the networking of communications systems has created new opportunities for these mixed-signal products. Examples of these products include chipsets for communication applications such as global system for mobile cellular phones, or GSM, cable modems, and broadband modems. Other examples include audio input/output devices for computer applications and electric motor control devices for industrial instrumentation.

existing products and processes. We spent approximately $512 million during fiscal 2004 on the design, development and improvement of new and existing products and processes, compared to approximately $450 million during fiscal 2003 and approximately $424 million during fiscal 2002. 
      Our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technologies for signal conditioning, conversion and processing. In support of our research and development activities, we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and process development at over 28 design centers and manufacturing sites located throughout the world. 

Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights 

      As of October 30, 2004, we held 935 United States patents and had 569 patent applications pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office with expiration dates ranging from 2004 through 2023. We believe that while our patents may provide some advantage, our competitive position is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge, ability and experience of our personnel, the range and number of new products being developed by us, our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts, customer service and technical support. It is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented, though we may elect, in certain cases, not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions, if other protection, such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret, is considered more advantageous. We also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine Analog Devices’ products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine Analog Devices’ components. In addition, we have registered certain of our mask sets under the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984. 

      There can be no assurance that any patent will issue on pending applications or that any patent issued will provide substantive protection for the technology or product covered by it. There also can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer our products or that our confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, silicon foundries and other suppliers and vendors will be adequate to protect our interests. Moreover, the laws of countries in which we design, manufacture and market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology. 

      The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See Note 11 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information concerning pending litigation that involves us. An adverse outcome in this or other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. 

Sales Channels 

      We sell our products in North America and internationally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our worldwide website on the Internet. 

      The fastest growing part of our business has been to customers in markets other than North America and Europe. Approximately 19% of our fiscal 2004 net sales were to customers in Japan. Approximately 14% of our fiscal 2004 net sales were to customers in China and approximately 22% were to customers elsewhere in Asia, principally Taiwan and Korea. As of October 30, 2004, we had direct sales offices in the Asia region in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan.

Table of Contents

      Approximately 25% of our fiscal 2004 net sales were to customers in North America. As of October 30, 2004, we had 10 direct sales offices in the United States. 

      Approximately 20% of our fiscal 2004 net sales were to customers in Europe. As of October 30, 2004, we had direct sales offices in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. 

      We also had sales representatives and/or distributors in over 45 countries outside North America, including countries where we also have direct sales offices. For further detail regarding financial information about geographic areas, see Note 3 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

      Approximately 50% of our fiscal 2004 revenue was derived from sales made through distributors. Revenue is deferred on sales made through distributors until the distributors resell the products to the end users. These distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. Some of them also sell products competitive with our products, including those for which we are an alternate source. Sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that provide protection to the distributors for their inventory of our products against price reductions and products that are slow-moving or that we have discontinued, including limited product return privileges. 

      Our worldwide technical direct field sales efforts are supported by an extensive promotional program that includes editorial coverage and paid advertising in trade publications, direct mail programs, promotional brochures, technical seminars and participation in trade shows. We publish and distribute full-length databooks, product catalogs, applications guides, technical handbooks and detailed data sheets for individual products. We also provide product and application information and sell products via our worldwide website on the Internet. We maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products. 

      We have tens of thousands of customers worldwide. Our largest single customer, excluding distributors, represented approximately 3% of our fiscal 2004 net sales, and our 20 largest customers, excluding distributors, accounted for approximately 29% of our fiscal 2004 net sales. 

Foreign Operations 

      Through subsidiaries and affiliates, we conduct business in numerous countries outside the United States. During fiscal 2004, approximately 75% of our revenue was derived from customers in international markets. Our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls, import and export controls, and other laws, policies and regulations of foreign governments. 

      We have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the United States economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, and the response to them by the United States and its allies. These risks include air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, and additional costs related to tax, tariff and freight rates. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other currencies. 

Production and Raw Materials 

      Monolithic integrated circuit components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication, wafer testing, cutting the wafer into individual “chips,” or dice, assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form. The raw materials used to

manufacture these devices include silicon wafers, processing chemicals (including liquefied gases), precious metals, ceramic and plastic used for packaging. 
      We develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating high-performance linear, mixed-signal and MEMS ICs. We also use bipolar and CMOS wafer fabrication processes. 

      Our IC products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by third-party wafer fabricators. Most of our analog products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes. Our DSP products, and a portion of our analog products, are manufactured at third-party wafer-fabrication foundries using sub-micron digital CMOS processes. We operate wafer fabrication facilities in Wilmington and Cambridge, Massachusetts; Sunnyvale, California and Limerick, Ireland. We also operate assembly and test facilities located in the Philippines and use third-party subcontractors. 

      Capital spending in fiscal 2004 was $146 million, compared with $68 million in fiscal 2003. We currently plan to make capital expenditures of approximately $150 million in fiscal 2005. We believe we currently have ample installed capacity to significantly increase internal production levels with modest additional capital expenditures. 

      Our products require a wide variety of components and raw materials, most of which we purchase from third-party suppliers. We have multiple sources for the majority of the components and materials we purchase and incorporate into our products. However, in some cases, we purchase components from sole-source suppliers, such as external foundries. If these sole-source suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. Although we have experienced shortages of components from time to time, these items have generally been available to us as needed. 

Backlog 

      Backlog at the end of fiscal 2004 was approximately $329 million, down from approximately $387 million at the end of fiscal 2003. This decrease was due to the reduced order levels and increased order cancellations as a result of what we believe was an inventory correction during our third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2004. We define backlog as of a particular date as firm orders with a customer requested delivery date within thirteen weeks. Backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers, including us, in periods of depressed demand. In periods of increased demand, there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and, in some instances, we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries delayed by customers without significant penalty. Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue. 

Government Contracts 

      We estimate that approximately 3% of our fiscal 2004 revenue was attributable to sales to the U.S. government and government contractors and subcontractors. Our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated, firm fixed-price subcontracts. All such contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the United States government. 

Competition 

      We compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive. We believe we are one of the largest suppliers of high-performance analog and mixed-signal processing components. Competitors for our analog and DSP products include Cirrus Logic Inc., Linear Technology Corporation, Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., National Semiconductor Corporation, Phillips Semiconductor, ST Microelectronics and Texas Instruments, Inc. Sales of our micromachined products are currently

Table of Contents

comprised of acceleration sensors and gyroscopes, and our main competitors in that market are Bosch, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Denso Corporation and ST Microelectronics. 
      We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for real-world signal processing components depends upon several factors, including technical innovation, product quality and reliability, range of products, product price, customer service and technical support. We believe our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability, supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support, enables us to compete in our chosen markets against both foreign and domestic semiconductor manufacturers. 

      Many other companies offer products that compete with our products, and some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical and marketing resources than we have. Additionally, some formerly-independent competitors have been purchased by larger companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products to markets we serve. There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition. 

Environment 

      Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, particularly with respect to industrial waste and emissions. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 

      We are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees, customers and the public. We endeavor to adhere to the most stringent standards across all of our facilities, to encourage pollution prevention and to strive towards continual improvement. We strive to exceed compliance with regulatory standards in order to achieve a standard of excellence in environmental, health and safety management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system. 

Employees 

      As of October 30, 2004, we employed approximately 8,900 individuals worldwide. Our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees, particularly those highly-skilled design, process, test and applications engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes. We believe that relations with our employees are good, however the competition for such personnel is intense, and the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on us.
