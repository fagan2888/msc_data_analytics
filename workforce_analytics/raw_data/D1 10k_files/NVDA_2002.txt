--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

process. We also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist PC OEMs, system integrators, motherboard manufacturers and add-in board manufacturers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving PC OEMs, system integrators, motherboard manufacturers and add-in board manufacturers time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction among PC OEMs, system integrators, motherboard manufacturers and add-in board manufacturers and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products. 
 
In the 3D graphics market, the sales process involves educating leading PC OEMs’, motherboard manufacturers’ and add-in board manufacturers’ graphics processor purchasing decisions regarding our products, achieving key design wins and supporting the product design into high volume production. These design wins in turn influence the retail and system integrator channel that is serviced by add-in board and motherboard manufacturers. Our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, motherboard manufacturers, add-in board manufacturers and stocking representatives that have relationships with a broad range of major PC OEMs and/or strong brand name recognition in the retail channel. Currently, we sell a significant majority of our graphics processors directly to CEMs, motherboard manufacturers and add-in board manufacturers, which then sell boards with our graphics processor to leading OEMs, retail outlets and to a large number of system integrators. 
 
To encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products, as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes products available to partners prior to volume availability to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products. 
 
Customers 
 
A majority of our sales have been to a limited number of customers and sales are highly concentrated. Sales to Edom Technology Co., Ltd., accounted for 20%, sales to Micro-Star accounted for 14% and sales to Atlantic Semiconductor accounted for 10% of our total revenue for fiscal 2002. Edom and Atlantic are independent stocking representatives and Micro-Star is a CEM and each purchase our products and resell these products to PC OEMs. Although Edom, Atlantic and Micro-Star represent major customers, our end customers include Acer, Apple, Compaq, Dell, eMachines, Fujitsu-Siemens, Gateway, HP, IBM, Micron, NEC, Packard Bell, SGI and Sony. 
 
Backlog 
 
Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of our products actually purchased by the customer as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions to reflect changes in the customers’ requirements and manufacturing availability. The semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules. In light of industry practice and experience, we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results. 
 
Manufacturing 
 
We have a “fabless” manufacturing strategy whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including fabrication, assembly and testing. This strategy leverages the expertise of industry-leading, ISO-certified suppliers in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability and testing. In addition, we are able to avoid the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. These suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing and customer support.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our graphics processors are primarily fabricated by TSMC and assembled and tested by Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, ChipPAC Incorporated and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. We receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and then ship them to CEMs, stocking representatives, motherboard and add-in board manufacturer customers from our Santa Clara, California warehouse and third-party warehouses in Singapore and Hong Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, then ship the products to the retail, system integrator or OEM markets as motherboard and add-in board solutions. Our hardware and software development teams work closely with certification agencies, Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs and our OEM customers to ensure that both our boards and software drivers are certified for inclusion in the OEMs’ products. 
 
Research and Development 
 
We believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading 3D graphics performance and features is essential to our future success. Our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of graphics processors using independent design teams. Our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering, hardware engineering, very large scale integration, or VLSI, design engineering, process engineering, and architecture and algorithms. These groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products. 
 
A critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the CAD industry. We have invested significant resources to develop relationships with industry leaders, including Avant! Corporation, Cadence Design Systems, Inc., IKOS Systems, Inc. and Synopsys, Inc., often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products. We believe that forming these relationships and utilizing next-generation development tools to design, simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3D graphics market and develop products on a rapid basis that utilize leading-edge technology. We believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of PC manufacturers. 
 
We have substantially increased our engineering and technical resources and have 619 full-time employees engaged in research and development as of January 27, 2002, compared to 458 employees as of January 28, 2001. During fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, we incurred research and development expenditures of $153.9 million, $86.0 million and $46.9 million, respectively. 
 
Competition 
 
The market for 3D graphics processors for PCs is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and distribution channels, backward-forward software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, price of graphics processors and total system costs of add-in boards or motherboards. We expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than our 3D graphics processors or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. 
 
Our primary source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide 3D graphics solutions for the PC market. Our competitors include the following: 
 
  •   suppliers of graphics add-in boards that utilize their internally developed graphics chips, such as ATI Technologies Inc. and Matrox Electronics Systems Ltd.;

  •   suppliers of integrated core logic chipsets that incorporate 2D and 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as Intel, Silicon Integrated Systems and Via Technologies, Inc.;  

 
  •   suppliers of mobile graphics processors that incorporate 2D or 3D graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions, such as ATI Technologies, Trident Microsystems, Inc. and the joint venture of a division of SONICblue Incorporated and Via Technologies; and  

 
  •   companies that have traditionally focused on the professional market and provide high end 3D solutions for PCs and workstations, including 3Dlabs Inc. and ATI Technologies.  

 
If and to the extent we offer products outside of the 3D graphics processor market, we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete. We cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter. 
 
Patents and Proprietary Rights 
 
We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property. As of January 27, 2002, we owned 70 issued United States patents, 8 issued foreign patents, and have 124 United States patent applications pending and 10 foreign patent applications pending. Our issued patents have expiration dates from September 4, 2007 to March 17, 2019. As of January 27, 2002, our patents and pending patent applications related to technology used by us in connection with our products, including our graphics processors. Our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved. In addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties. The enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business. We have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our graphics processors, and expect to continue to enter into license agreements for future products. These licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties, the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could suffer. 
 
Employees 
 
As of January 27, 2002 we had 1,123 employees, 619 of whom were engaged in research and development and 504 of whom were engaged in sales, marketing, operations and administrative positions. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationships with our employees are good.
