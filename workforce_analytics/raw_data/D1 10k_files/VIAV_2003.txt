ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 


General 

        We are a worldwide leader in optical technology. We design and manufacture products for fiberoptic communications, as well as for markets where our core optics technologies provide innovative solutions for industrial, commercial and consumer applications. Our fiberoptic components and modules are deployed by system manufacturers for the telecommunications, data communications and cable television industries. We also offer products through original equipment manufacturers for display, security, medical/environmental instrumentation, decorative, aerospace and defense applications. 

        Fiberoptic communications systems enable transmission of video, audio and text data over high-capacity fiberoptic cables. Although ultimately highly complex, a fiberoptic communications system performs three basic functions common to all communications systems: transmitting, routing (switching) and receiving information, in this case information encoded on light signals. Our fiberoptic components, modules and subsystems, alone and in combinations, are the building blocks for these systems. These products include transmitters, receivers, amplifiers, dispersion compensators, multiplexers and demultiplexers, add/drop modules, switches, optical performance monitors and couplers, splitters and circulators. Complementing our components, modules and subsystem products, our test and measurement equipment is used in manufacturing, research and development, system development and network maintenance environments for measuring performance of optical components. We sell our communications products to the world's leading and emerging telecommunications, data communications and cable television systems providers worldwide. 

        In addition to fiberoptic communications, we apply our optical technologies for use in the display, security, medical/environmental, instrumentation, and aerospace and defense markets. Products of these businesses rely on optical technologies to control, enhance and modify the behavior of light utilizing its reflection, absorption and transmission properties to achieve specific effects such as high reflectivity, anti-glare and spectral filtering. Specific product applications include computer monitors and flat panel displays, projection systems, photocopiers, facsimile machines, scanners, security products and decorative surface treatments. We also supply laser products for biotechnology, graphic arts and imaging, semiconductor processing, materials processing, and a variety of other laser-based applications. 

        As further discussed in "Operating Segments and Products," we group our communications and non-communications products into two principal segments which we call the Communications Products Group and the Thin Film Products Group.

Industry Environment 

        During the second half of the 1990's through 2000, the telecommunications industry experienced a period of considerable growth, and we participated in that growth as a leading supplier to these markets. This growth was attributable primarily to: 

•
the introduction of wavelength division multiplexing ("WDM") technology, under which multiple light signals are transmitted down a single optical fiber cable. WDM allowed the expansion of 
3


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fiberoptic network capacity without the expense and time required to install additional fiber cable, and provided greater capacity on new fiber; 

•
the unprecedented growth in data traffic, in general, and the Internet, in particular, which created rapidly increasing demand for larger, faster and more robust networks (commonly collectively referred to as "bandwidth"); 


•
the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which purported to open existing proprietary telecommunications infrastructures to multiple carriers, and, as a consequence, created a market for new telecommunications carriers (called competitive local exchange carriers or "CLECs"), each of which moved rapidly to deploy its own network; and 


•
an abundance of relatively low cost capital available for new company formation, network development and expansion. 
        Together, these factors engendered the rapid and substantial installation of fiberoptic networks, largely financed by debt, in anticipation of rapidly growing bandwidth demand and future sales. As a result of the increasing demand, we focused much of our efforts on expanding our business, internally and through acquisitions, to meet the increasingly urgent needs of our customers for higher performance products, increased product breadth and expanded manufacturing capacity. Consequently, our sales grew rapidly, increasing from $87.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 1999 to $925.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2000. 

        Beginning in early 2001, the telecommunications industry began experiencing a dramatic downturn, the primary direct cause of which was and continues to be a precipitous decrease in network deployment and capital spending by the telecommunications carriers. This decrease is attributable to, among other things: 

•
network overcapacity in long haul and network core markets as bandwidth demand, while continuing to grow, did not reach levels sufficient to match the pace of network deployment; 


•
constrained capital markets; 


•
financial difficulties of certain major telecommunications carriers; and 


•
other factors, including the general inability of the CLECs to obtain sufficient access to established telecommunications infrastructures, and consolidation among telecommunications carriers. 


        All of these factors contributed to a severe decline in overall demand for new fiberoptic networks and the components and modules used therein. During most of 2001 and continuing through today, our telecommunications systems manufacturing customers have worked to reduce their inventories of components and modules purchased from our competitors and us. Excess network capacity and limited availability of capital for network installation and expansion have constrained the ability of these inventories to be absorbed quickly. As the downturn deepened and continued, many telecommunications systems manufacturers and their carrier customers were faced with insufficient revenues and cash reserves to service and repay the significant debt they incurred during the prior growth period, or to otherwise sustain their operations. Many of these companies began major efforts to restructure their debt, reduce their costs and establish sufficient revenues. Some of them have not succeeded and others may not succeed in these efforts, in which event they will be liquidated or acquired and consolidated. Also, during this time many of the CLECs have gone out of business, reducing the demand for new networks. As a result, the overall market for new telecommunications systems and, accordingly, for our products, has declined. 

        The impact of industry consolidation, continued inventory reductions among our customers, increasing debt concerns at the systems manufacturer and carrier levels, network overcapacity, and 

4


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


limited access to capital for network installation and expansion has severely harmed our business. While the declines have slowed substantially and we have seen signs of stability in the market recently, we do not anticipate any significant recovery in the near future.

        Nevertheless, we believe the telecommunications industry will ultimately improve from the current economic slowdown and grow in the future for several reasons:

•
Internet traffic, an important driver of network expansion, continues, and we believe will continue, to grow at significant rates; 


•
Internet traffic is increasingly expected to include content such as full motion video on demand (including high definition video) multichannel high quality audio, online video conferencing, image transfer, online gaming and other broadband applications, the delivery of which will place greater demand on available bandwidth; 


•
North America and Europe have comprised the majority of optical networking deployment, but we believe there could be significant additional potential with the eventual development of other geographical markets, including Latin America and Asia; 


•
While fiberoptic networks currently have sufficient capacity for long haul, city-to-city, and undersea applications, new markets, including intra-city metro and access, and, ultimately, fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) remain largely untapped. We believe these markets represent a significant future opportunity for our industry and for us. Moreover, we anticipate that installation of fiberoptic systems into these markets will increase demand for long-haul capacity as overall network traffic expands; 


•
We believe the availability and popularity of WiFi (Wireless Fidelity Technology—802.11b) access has the potential to increase Internet traffic while making access to the Internet portable and secure; and 


•
The demand for client-side or enterprise-level communications networks is expected to continue to increase as global organizations continue to upgrade and expand their information systems. 
        Consequently, we anticipate that over the long-term, fiberoptic communications network development and expansion both through the installation of new networks and through the upgrade and expansion of existing networks will continue. However, given our current lack of visibility, we cannot provide any assurance as to the timing or extent of any industry recovery or as to any increase in business or other benefits that we may receive as a result. 

        While we continue to experience weakness in our Communication Products Group, during fiscal 2003 our Thin Film Products Group of businesses have made significant contributions to our operating results. 

        We believe that the businesses reported under our Thin Film Products segment will continue to be supported by consumer and industrial spending and will grow in the future for several reasons:

•
The display market, particularly rear-projection television sets and plasma displays, are expected to increase: 


•
Security and authentication markets are expected to continue to grow to address counterfeit concerns; 


•
There has been increased interest and demand internationally for bio-hazard detection and other security applications and we believe that these markets have potential to increase in both the public and private sectors. 
        However, due to the current economic uncertainty, vertical product consolidations occurring in these businesses and other factors, our net sales in our display business declined during our fourth quarter and are expected to decline during the near term. Our ability to predict our future revenue 

5


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


levels in these markets is extremely limited in the near term and we are unable to predict the timing or extent of any potential growth in such markets. 

Global Realignment Program 

        In April 2001, we initiated our Global Realignment Program, under which we continue to restructure our business in response to the current and anticipated market environment and as part of our continuing efforts to integrate our operations. The majority of the actions and announcements under the Global Realignment Program are expected to be completed by the end of December 2003. However, as our visibility is limited and we continue to respond to our uncertain environment, there can be no assurance that such actions and announcements will in fact be completed by such time, and, in fact, we may be required to take additional actions, incur additional costs, and make additional announcements under the program. 

        Specific actions to-date include the following: 

•
We have terminated 19,347 employees under the Global Realignment Program. As of June 30, 2003, we had 5,489 employees. 
The following table presents a history of our employment levels:

•
We have eliminated many product development programs and are continuing to consolidate or curtail others in order to focus our research and development investments on the most promising projects in both the Communications Products Group and the Thin Film Products Group. 


•
We are increasing our reliance on our contract manufacturing partners primarily for our communications products and are continuing to centralize in-house manufacturing processes to our low-cost Shenzhen facility. It is important to note that the changes made to our manufacturing strategy through, among other things, the Global Realignment Program represent a fundamental shift in the way we make our telecommunications products. Historically, we generally manufactured our telecommunications products in-house, with considerable manual labor at various locations within our global organization. Our products were highly customized to particular customer specifications, which could vary significantly from customer to customer, and which led to a very large product catalog. More recently, we have: 


•
substantially rationalized our product catalog; 


•
encouraged product standardization across customers, as exemplified by our network-ready products; 


•
increased our reliance on out-sourced manufacturing to assemble and package our more commonly demanded products; and 
6


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•
moved labor intensive, high volume manufacturing operations to our Shenzhen facility. 
We may not be successful in our manufacturing strategy. There are many risks to be addressed, as more particularly described in the "Risk Factors" section below. However, if we fail to adjust to the market realities by, among other things, restructuring the manner in which we make our products, we will not succeed in the telecommunications industry in the future. 

•
We have consolidated manufacturing, research and development, sales and administrative facilities through building and site closures. As of June 30, 2003, 29 sites and buildings in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific have been closed or were scheduled for closure. The process involves consolidating product lines, standardizing on global product designs, and transferring manufacturing to optimal locations. 
The 29 sites closed or scheduled for closure were as follows: 

North America: Asheville, North Carolina; Columbus, Ohio; Eatontown, New Jersey; Freehold, New Jersey; Gloucester, Massachusetts; Horsham, Pennsylvania; Manteca, California; Ottawa, Ontario (2 sites); Piscataway, New Jersey; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richardson, Texas; Rochester, New York; San Jose, California (2sites); Toronto, Ontario; Victoria, British Columbia. 

Europe: 
Arnhem, Netherlands; Bracknell, United Kingdom; Eindhoven, Netherlands; Hillend, United Kingdom; Oxford, United Kingdom; Plymouth, United Kingdom; Torquay, United Kingdom; Waghaeusel-Kirrlach, Germany; Witham, United Kingdom. 

Asia-Pacific: 
Shunde, China; Sydney, Australia; Taipei, Taiwan. 

•
We have centralized many administrative functions such as information technology, human resources and finance to take advantage of synergies, economies of scale and common processes and controls. 
        Prior to the inception of the Global Realignment Program in April 2001, our annual spending rate excluding inventory material costs was approximately $1.7 billion. We expect to reduce our annual expenses by approximately $1.3 billion after the majority of the Global Realignment Program has been implemented,which is expected by the end of December 2003. We believe that the measures taken under the Global Realignment Program will provide us the flexibility to meet our customers' current operating needs without sacrificing our ability to expand our business and respond to future increases in business levels. However, the Global Realignment Program may not be successful in achieving the expected cost reductions or other benefits, may be insufficient to align our operations with customer demand and the changes affecting our industry, or may be more costly or extensive than currently anticipated. 

        Our results of operations and financial condition were significantly affected by charges related to our Global Realignment Program, the write-downs of inventories, and the impairment of our investments and long-lived assets during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001. Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on these charges. 

Acquisitions 

        Notwithstanding the current economic downturn, we are committed to continuing to evaluate strategic opportunities and pursue acquisitions of additional products, technologies or businesses that are complementary to or broaden the markets for our products. During fiscal 2003, we acquired the following businesses/companies: the transceiver/transponder business unit from OptronX, Inc.; L.A. Label Corporation; and the undersea pump laser business of TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. We cannot 

7


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


assure you that any of these acquisitions will be successfully integrated into our operations or that we will receive any benefits from the same. 

Transceiver/Transponder Business Unit of OptronX, Inc.: 

        In September 2002 we acquired the transceiver/transponder business unit of OptronX, Inc., which provides leading 200 and 300 pin, low-cost, small form factor, optical transport modules. With the acquisition, we added short reach and very short reach models to our 10 Gb/s transponder line, thereby broadening an offering that already includes several reaches, rates and form factors. 

        Under the terms of this acquisition, we paid $6.2 million in cash and may be required to make a contingent payment of up to $4.5 million in cash based on the financial performance of OptronX in calendar year 2003. 

L.A. Label: 

        In January 2003, we acquired L.A. Label Corporation in order to expand our capabilities to provide integrated optical technology solutions for product security and brand authentication. Flex Products Division, in our Thin Film Product Group, manufacturers interference pigments that are used for counterfeit protection and authentication applications. The addition of L.A. Label, which has been supplying quality, custom, printed pressure sensitive labels and packaging solutions for over 60 years, opens opportunities in new markets and enables new products and services. Flex's SecureShift™ can now be integrated into labels and packaging for applications such as software, CDs, videos, apparel, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and numerous other consumer and luxury items. 

        Under the terms of the acquisition, total consideration consisted of $19.4 million in cash of which we paid $17.4 million to the former owners of L.A. Label. We have retained $2 million of the cash consideration for any future liabilities we may incur resulting from any breach of general representations or warranties made by the former shareholders of L.A. Label. 

Submarine Pump Packaging: 

        In May 2003, we acquired from TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. certain intellectual property and manufacturing assets to be used in the packaging of our pump lasers (primarily used in submarine applications) This acquisition was consistent with our strategy to provide higher levels of integration, and helps position us to be a leading supplier of submarine pump modules. Due to the cost of installing and servicing submarine networks, all components and modules are required to meet very strict performance and qualification criteria. We believe as a result of this acquisition, our submarine pump modules will meet these very strict performance and qualification criteria.

        Under the terms of the acquisistion, we paid $6.6 million in cash to acquire these assets. 

        Please refer to "Note 16. Mergers and Acquisitions" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these acquisitions. 

Operating Segments and Products 

        We operate in two principal segments through which we develop and manufacture our telecommunications and non-telecommunications products: (i) Communication Products, which accounted for approximately 49% of our net sales in fiscal 2003, and (ii) Thin Film Products, which accounted for approximately 51% of our net sales in fiscal 2003. Please refer to "Note 17. Operating Segments and Geographic Information" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our operating segments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Communications Products: 

        Our fiberoptic communications products include a broad range of components, modules and subsystems better enabling our customers to satisfy all of their requirements through "one-stop" shopping at a single supplier. We also leverage our broad-based component portfolio to provide higher levels of integration in modules and subsystems to create value-added solutions for our customers. Our product categories are described below. 

        Source Lasers:    At the front end of the network, a source laser provides the initial signal that is transmitted over the network. These source lasers are characterized by their wavelength and power levels. Power, which is measured in milliwatts, generally determines the ability of the source laser to transmit over longer distances, with higher power source lasers enabling greater initial transmission distances. A single source laser is required for each channel in a WDM system. We produce both continuous wave lasers for external modulation as well as directly modulated lasers for a variety of telecom and cable television systems. 

        Photodetectors and Receivers:    Photodetectors and receivers detect the optical signals and convert them back into electronic signals. Photodetectors, when co-packaged with an electronic preamplifier, are referred to as receivers. We supply optical photodetectors and receivers for fiberoptic telecommunications and cable television networks. Receivers are used in WDM products for each channel at both ends of the fiberoptic link as wavelength translation is required. Photodetectors are also used throughout a network to monitor a variety of characteristics including power levels and channel count. 

        Modulators:    Modulators turn light on and off external to the source laser to encode the information being sent through the network. External modulation can be achieved either by using a separate discrete modulator or by monolithically integrating a laser and modulator. We supply both types of modulators. The highest performance is obtained with a discrete external modulator. 

        Wavelength Lockers:    We supply wavelength lockers that are used to stabilize the wavelength of lasers used in dense WDM transmission systems. These lockers ensure that, over the lifetime of the system, the wavelength of a source laser does not drift to interfere with an adjacent wavelength channel. The locker operates by filtering and detecting a small amount of the source-laser light and providing a stabilizing feedback signal to the laser. 

        Transmitters:    We manufacture transmitters that combine source lasers, modulators, wavelength lockers and electronic drivers so that the optical signal is created and encoded in a single package. 

        Transceivers:    Transceivers combine transmitters with receivers so that signals can be generated and encoded, and received and detected in a single package. These modules are installed at both ends of a system. We supply transceivers in various form factors and specifications to both the data communications and telecommunications markets. 

        Transponders:    Transponders are transceivers that include electrical multiplexing and demultiplexing functions. They include signal receivers or transmitters that respond to or send signals. Transponders are often used as input interfaces between the optical and electrical signals for WDM systems. 

        Cable Television Transmitters and Amplifiers:    In cable television networks we supply externally modulated transmitters and amplifiers for trunk-line applications, directly modulated transmitters for the distribution portion of cable television networks, return-path lasers for interactive communications and transmitters providing both analog and digital signals to the recipient. 

9


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        Amplifiers:    We supply both Erbium-doped fiber amplifier ("EDFA") optical amplifiers and Raman amplification pump modules. These products cover a wide range of functionality and are designed to boost WDM and SDH optical signals without reconversion to electrical signal and permit an optical signal to travel a greater distance between electronic terminals and regenerators. These modules include multiple passive and active components such as couplers, isolators, pump combiners and pump lasers. 

        Pump Lasers:    Pump lasers are used in optical amplifiers within networks to regenerate the light signal that naturally suffers loss over distance within the network. Optical amplifiers each contain from one to six pump lasers depending on amplifier performance requirements. We supply 980-nanometer and 1480-nanometer pump lasers that are used in optical amplifiers. These pumps are used to energize the erbium-doped fiber that comprises the amplifier. We also supply 14xx-nanometer (wavelength tailored) pump lasers that are utilized in Raman modules to create gain in the transmission fiber, allowing the signal to travel farther without electrical regeneration. 

        Add-Drop Multiplexers:    We supply add-drop multiplexers that allow systems to add and drop optical wavelengths without reconversion to an electrical signal. For example, a system operating from San Francisco to New York can drop one wavelength in Chicago and add another allowing for greater network flexibility. The modules include multiple components such as switches, wavelength mutiplexers/demultiplexers devices, and attenuators. 

        WDM Couplers, Filters, Isolators and Circulators:    Wavelength division multiplexer couplers are used to split and combine signals of different wavelengths in an optical network. We supply WDM demultiplexers and access/bi-directional couplers. These products are based on thin-film filters, arrayed waveguide gratings, fused fiber couplers, microlenses and/or special optical materials. Isolator products are used to allow light signals in a network to propagate in one direction within a network, but prevent that signal from returning in the opposite direction. Circulators also allow light in a system to flow in only one direction, but have multiple ports and use these multiple ports to perform a routing function within the network. We supply various types of isolators and circulators including tunable narrow-bandpass filters that are wavelength-tunable by voltage control. 

        Switches and Attenuators:    Optical switches are used to route and switch signals to different destinations within networks. Attenuators are used to adjust the power of the optical signal to be compatible with the optical receivers within a network system. We supply both discrete devices and modules, including dynamically reconfigurable modules, containing a number of these components. 

        Telecommunications Specialty Modules:    We supply a number of specialty products for multi-gigabit fiberoptic systems. 

        Instrumentation:    Test instruments are used for testing and measuring optical components. Many of the test instruments were originally developed for evaluating our own optical components during design and production. We pioneered the development of swept wavelength systems, which are faster and allow more measurements over smaller wavelength ranges than previous methods. In fiscal 2002, we introduced our Multiple Application Platform ("MAP"), the next generation platform for our line of fiberoptic test and measurement instrumentation. MAP, now with 21 modules, provides a wide range of test and measurement switches and attenuators in a modular and upgradeable architecture suitable for research and development and manufacturing environments. 

        Network Ready Products:    Network Ready Products are a family of plug-and-play, carrier-class products for metro edge and access applications including amplification, reach extension, fiber relief, protection switching, and optical demarcation. They offer a low cost alternative for enabling DWDM and CWDM networking and new wavelength services. Their simplicity and modularity also allows carriers and system integrators to quickly respond to emerging revenue opportunities by deploying new

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


services such as Ethernet and SAN, while saving operational costs and avoiding sizeable capital expenditures. 

        The following are some of the significant products introduced by the Communication Products operating segment during fiscal 2003: 

•
Fibre Channel and Gigabit Ethernet Transceivers for local area network and storage area network data communication applications available in tri-speed (1.25 Gb/s Ethernet, 1 and 2 Gb/s Fibre Channel and Ethernet) models. The small form factor pluggable transceivers can be installed while the system is "live" and offer either the patented plastic pull tab or metal bail latch designs that ease installation in restricted spaces to enable denser system designs. Some models also feature digital diagnostic monitoring used for module identification, control and status. 


•
10 Gb/s XENPAK transceivers for high speed data communications applications. XENPAK refers to a multi-source agreement for form, fit and function by providing mechanical, electrical and optical standards and the first 10 Gb/s Ethernet transceiver standard to gain support from most of the leading vendors. 


•
The OA 300, a palm-sized amplifier for metro and access C-band applications is the tiniest of the OA Series at only 45 × 70 × 12 mm and draws less than 1 W of power. The OA Series is the broadest offering of standard (off-the-shelf availability) amplifiers in the industry, offering flexible, scalable amplifier platforms without the cost and time required for custom development. 


•
The SWS-OMNI-II and new MAP cassettes were among the new test and measurement instrumentation products introduced. Based on patented swept wavelength measurement technology, the SWS-OMNI-II provides high resolution measurements at a speed that is 10-15 times faster than previous products. The Multiple Application Platform (MAP) is a modular test instrument. Nine new cassettes for the MAP were introduced, bringing the total to 21 and offering a widely scalable, upgradeable, flexible test instumment for measuring the performance of optical components. 


•
CT2 Series 2.5 Gb/s, Small Form Factor Pluggable (SFP) transceiver for fiberoptic data communications and telecommunications. In addition to being fully OC-48, OC-12, and OC-3 SONET compliant, the CT2 is designed for 1310 and 1550 nm wavelengths and for short, intermediate, and long reach applications. The small, data communications style package meets the SFP multi source agreement requirements and uses industry standard, plug-in, LC duplex type optical connectors, which are easy to install and resistant to damage. Superior performance in critical areas, such as jitter generation, enables SONET communications, making the CT2 Series well suited for network edge applications. 


•
The WaveReady™ Series of optical access products can be installed in minutes and includes a CWDM solution that helps lower network costs for large enterprises and metro service providers. As network traffic continues to increase, service providers have been adopting dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) systems to expand capacity for metro core applications. For metro access applications, coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM) typically meets the required capacity but costs less than DWDM. In addition to CWDM and DWDM, the WaveReady Series fits a variety of applications including wavelength services, amplification, protection switching, reach extension, 1310/1550 overlay and Gigabit Ethernet services. 


Thin Film Products: 

        Our Thin Film Products represents the company's center of excellence for thin film coating and bulk optics capablilities. Optical thin film coatings are microscopic layers of materials, such as silicon 

11


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


and magnesium fluoride, applied to the surface of a substrate, such as glass, plastic or metal, to alter its optical properties. Thin film coatings work by controlling, enhancing or modifying the behavior of light to produce specific effects such as reflection, refraction, absorption, abrasion resistance, anti-glare and electrical conductivity. This control is achieved as a result of the optical properties, number of layers and thickness of the thin film coatings in relation to wavelengths of light. The ability to control the behavior of light using thin film coatings plays a critical role in many industries and products. 

        The Thin Film Products Group has direct responsibility for leveraging its technologies into the following markets outside of communications. 

Display: 

        In the display market, we manufacture and sell optical components and front surface mirrors used in front and rear projection displays, and plasma panel displays. These display products are used in both in-home and business display systems. 

Custom Optics: 

        The aerospace and medical/environmental instrumentation markets require sophisticated, custom, high-precision coated products and optical components that selectively absorb, transmit or reflect light in order to meet the specific performance requirements of advanced systems. Our products include infrared filters, beam splitters and optical sensors for aerospace applications, optical filters for medical instruments and solar cell covers for satellite. Our products in the office automation market include photoreceptors and front surface mirrors for photocopiers, document scanners, overhead projectors, facsimile machines and printers. 

Light Interference Pigments: 

        Light interference pigments create unique color shifting characteristics utilized in security products and decorative surface treatments. Our security products are light interface pigments, which allow ink to exhibit different colors from different viewing angles. The pigments are used to inhibit counterfeiting of currencies and other valuable documents such as passports and credit cards We have also launched a line of products incorporating proprietary interference technologies to protect brand name luxury goods and prescription drugs from counterfeits. 

        We have a line of decorative products that utilize similar manufacturing processes as our security products, but are designed to have certain color characteristics that make it attractive for applications in paints, cosmetics and plastics. The pigments create a durable color shifting finish when used in these applications. 

Lasers: 

        Our laser subsystems products are used in biotechnology, graphic arts and imaging, semiconductor processing, materials processing, and a wide variety of other laser-based applications. These products consist of air-cooled argon gas laser subsystems, which generally emit blue or green light, helium-neon lasers, which generally emit red or green light, and solid state lasers, which generally emit infrared, ultraviolet and green light. These systems consist of a combination of a laser head containing the lasing medium, power supply, cabling and packaging, including heat dissipation elements. 

        Our helium-neon lasers have become the industry standard for many applications. They are small, stable, have instant-on capability and are currently deployed in advanced applications such as digital radiography. Our air-cooled argon laser subsystems feature an integral-mirror and metal-ceramic laser tube. Other products include a new generation of diode-pumped solid state lasers, indium gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide laser diodes, and fiber lasers deployed in marking and materials processing applications.

Display Engines—Our Ultrex™ and DefiniTV™ light engine modules represent world-class performance for brightness, contrast, and price in both LCOS and DLP-based rear projection display applications. These products are designed to be used in large screen consumer and business high definition display applications. 
Competitive Environment 

        We compete against numerous fiberoptic component, module, subsystem and instrumentation manufacturers, including independent merchant suppliers and business units within vertically integrated equipment manufacturers, some of whom are also our customers. A partial list of these competitors includes: Agilent Technologies ("Agilent"), Avanex, Bookham Technology, Chorum Technologies, Emcore, Exfo, Finisar, Fujitsu, Furukawa Electric, Intel, New Focus, Oplink Communications, OpNext, Sumitomo Electric and TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. In addition to these established companies, we also face competition from emerging start-up companies, many of which continue to actively pursue our markets, notwithstanding the continuing economic uncertainty. While each of our product families has multiple competitors, we believe that we have the broadest range of products and technology available in the industry. We also believe that this range of products and technology will help position us well in the industry as it continues to move towards module and subsystem level products. Due to economic uncertainty and changes within the telecommunications industry, some of our current and former competitors have sold or discontinued their fiberoptic communications businesses, and we expect that there will continue to be further consolidation in our industry.

        The following developments in our telecommunications markets during the past twelve months provide perspective on the dramatic changes occurring in this industry, in response to the continuing economic uncertainty and the decline in the telecommunications systems market: 

•
A year ago, our most significant competitors in the the telecommunications industry were the optical components divisions of Nortel, Agere, Corning and Alcatel. 


•
In November, 2002, Nortel sold its optical components division to Bookham. 


•
In January, 2003 Agere sold most of its optical components business to TriQuint. (We subsequently acquired the undersea pump laser portion of this business from TriQuint.) Also in January, 2003, Agere sold the remainder of this business to Emcore. 


•
In July, 2003 Alcatel and Corning sold their respective optical components businesses to Avanex. 


•
As a result of these developments, Nortel, Agere, Corning and Alcatel are no longer engaged in the optical components business. They have been succeeded by new participants, such as TriQuint, as well as developing participants, such as Bookham, Avanex, Emcore, and a host of privately held companies. 
13


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        We believe that established fiberoptic communications system suppliers will continue to seek more integration and module-level solutions from their vendors. This approach provides the following potential advantages: (i) it allows our systems manufacturing customers to focus on the overall system design and architecture of their products and (ii) it also may allow them to reduce their cost structure and decrease their time to market. In this environment, we believe that our experience with a broad range of products and technologies gives us an advantage in designing module-level solutions and in assisting customers in the application of these products throughout their networks.

        Moreover, we believe that telecommunications systems manufacturers will seek to further consolidate their vendor relationships, strengthening ties with established industry leaders, like us, and eliminate or reduce their dependence on smaller and less secure suppliers. We believe our broad product portfolio, financial stability, commitment to research and development, and high qualification standards increasingly position us to compete to be the supplier of choice to these companies now and in the future.

        In our Thin Film Products Group, we strive to be a principal supplier to most of our key customers. In the document and product security markets, we face competition from alternative anti-counterfeiting devices such as holograms, embedded threads and watermarks. In the decorative market, we face competition from providers of lower cost, lower performance special effect pigments, including BASF and Merck KGaA. In the flat panel display market, we face competition from Japanese coating companies such as Nidek, Toppan and Tore. In projection display components, our competition includes Viratec, Nitto Optical, Nikon and Fuji Photo-Optical. In our customer optics markets we compete with companies such as Deposition Sciences, Barr Associates, and Sonoma Photonics. We provide commercial laser products to OEM suppliers for biotechnology instruments, reprographics, and semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and compete with companies such as Coherent, Melles Griot and Spectra-Physics. 

Strategy 

        Our objective is to continue to be a leading supplier of components, modules and subsystems for fiberoptic communications and to maintain or expand our position in other markets where there is demand for our optics technologies, including display, security, medical/environmental instrumentation, decorative, aerospace and defense applications. 

        The key elements of our strategy include: 

•
Maintaining close customer relationships. We work closely with our customers from initial product design through to manufacturing and delivery. We strive to engage with our customers at the early stages of system development to provide them with their entire component and module. Maintaining and strengthening these relationships is particularly critical during the current telecommunications industry slowdown. Accordingly, the reorganization and focusing of our sales, customer support, product marketing and development efforts to strengthen and streamline our customer relationships continues to be a fundamental aspect of our strategy. 


•
Maintaining technology leadership to address growth markets. We believe that our technology and product leadership is a significant advantage and we will continue to develop our core competencies in what we believe are the enabling technologies to address current and future needs in our key markets. The application of optical technology to provide innovative solutions for industrial, commercial and consumer applications is a common goal for our employees and our customers across market and geographical boundaries. We expect to continue to invest significantly in new technology and product developments that will allow us to offer increased efficiency, performance, functionality, and higher levels of integration to our customers. We endeavor to anticipate and respond to changes in market conditions and demands by adapting our organization and targeting and investing in those technologies and applications that we believe will offer the best solutions for our customers' future needs. 
14


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•
Increasing focus on the most promising communications markets while maintaining capabilities to support our customers throughout the network. We believe that our customers' ability to offer robust, dynamic high bandwidth systems to their carrier customers on a cost-effective basis will be integral to an industry recovery and future growth. Our stability and "end-to-end" broad product portfolio offer potential benefits to customers who are designing future platforms and want high assurance of the reliability of supply and/or can achieve economies in procurement and logistics by choosing one supplier in place of several. We are responding to our customers' current needs in the metro, access and enterprise markets while retaining our capabilities for the long haul terrestrial and submarine markets. In addition, our customers continue to seek an increase in the level of integration and functionality in the optoelectronic and optical products they purchase from their suppliers. We believe that greater integration and increased functionality for components, modules and subsystems provides them with overall system cost savings potential. Furthermore, we believe that reducing the amount of integration required to be performed by our customers allows them to focus on building system architectures, reduce their cost of development, maintaining core competencies and related competitive strengths. 


•
Strengthening and developing opportunities for the markets that we serve through our Thin Film Products Group. We are increasing our efforts to capitalize on our core thin film coating and bulk optics competence in our display, document security, brand security, product differentiation, medical/environmental intrumentations, printing, and aerospace and defense markets. Despite the current economic slowdown, our display, product, security and aerospace and defense businesses have been relatively stable. For example, people continue investing in new entertainment systems for their homes. Moreover, as brand name owners around the world are seeking new ways to keep their products secure, our sales for security markings have grown. We believe these and other opportunities for our thin film coating and bulk optics technologies will be important to our future success as it also helps to maintain our leadership position in these fields to help meet the needs of our communications customers. 


•
Focusing on continuous quality improvement. We are committed to continuous improvement in the quality of our products and processes. This commitment includes efforts to minimize product failures in part by learning from those that do occur, improve the performance and reliability of our products, as well as the manufacturing processes used to provide our products. We also strive for continuous improvement in our customer relationships including pre-and post-sales services and understanding and responding to customer requirements. 


•
Structuring our manufacturing capabilities for maximum efficiency and quality. Prior to the industry downturn and in response to increasing customer demand, we expanded our worldwide manufacturing capacity through a number of initiatives. We have shifted our manufacturing focus from capacity expansion to maximizing efficiency, quality, cost reduction and process-focused manufacturing. Consequently, a critical goal of our Global Realignment Program has been to reorganize and consolidate our manufacturing operations into those locations best suited economically, technologically and geographically to manufacture our products while consistently meeting our customers' quality and performance requirements. For example, we are moving the manufacturing of many of our established communications products to our facility in Shenzhen, China and we are increasing our reliance on low-cost contract manufacturing partners. When our restructuring is completed, we expect production to be centralized in designated competency centers in order to enhance productivity and quality and streamline operations. 


•
Pursuing complementary mergers and acquisitions. We continue to believe that complementary acquisitions and other strategic transactions will be important to our future success. Accordingly, we continue actively to evaluate and pursue opportunities to invest in, acquire and develop strategic relationships with other businesses in circumstances that we believe meet our other strategic objectives. 
15


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•
Developing our people. Our management and employees have formed a culture of innovation, adaptability and resilience that has proven its strength through extreme changes in the market. We are focused on retaining key contributors, developing our people and nurturing this level of commitment. 
        Although we expect to be successful in implementing our strategy, many factors, some within and some outside of our control, may cause us to fail to achieve one or more of our strategic goals. Some of these factors are discussed under "Risk Factors" below. 

Sales and Marketing 

        We market our products primarily to original equipment manufacturers, distributors and strategic partners in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Our sales organizations communicate directly with customers' engineering, manufacturing and purchasing personnel in determining the design, performance and cost specifications for customer product requirements. Our customers for fiberoptic communications solutions include Agilent, Alcatel, Ciena, Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, Huawei, IBM, Lucent, Nortel, SBC Communications and Scientific-Atlanta. Our customers within the Thin Film Products Group include Agilent, Applied Biosystems, Eastman Kodak, Hitachi, KLA Tencor, Mitsubishi, SICPA, Sony, Texas Instruments and Toshiba. 

        During fiscal 2003, Texas Instruments accounted for 12% of net sales. During fiscal 2002, no customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales. During fiscal 2001, Nortel, Alcatel and Lucent accounted for 14%, 12% and 10% of net sales, respectively. 

        We believe that a high level of customer support is necessary to develop and maintain long-term relationships with our customers. Each relationship begins at the design-in phase and is maintained as customer needs change and evolve. We provide direct service and support to our customers through our offices in North America, Asia and Europe. In connection with our Global Realignment Program, we have aligned our sales organization in the communications business to offer customers a single point of contact for all of their product requirements, and created centers of excellence to streamline customer interactions with product line managers. We are also continuing to consolidate administrative functions to provide improved customer service and reduce our costs. 

Research and Development 

        During fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, we incurred research and development expenses of $153.7 million, $254.8 million and $325.9 million, respectively. 

        We devote substantial resources to research and development in order to develop new and enhanced fiberoptic components, modules and subsystems, as well as products to serve our display, document and product security, medical/environmental instrumentation and laser markets. Once the design of a product is complete, our engineering efforts shift to enhancing both the performance of that product and our ability to manufacture it at high volumes and at lower cost. 

        For the communications marketplace, we are increasing our focus on the most promising markets while maintaining our capability to provide products throughout the network. We are increasing our emphasis on the products needed for metro, access, local area network, storage area network, and enterprise markets. As a result, we are increasing our investment in transmission modules and components required in those markets. We are also responding to our customers' requests for higher levels of integration, including the integration of optics, electronics and software. 

        In businesses we serve out of our Thin Film Products Group, we devote substantial resources to research and development to, among other things; develop new and improved thin film products, processes and manufacturing equipment. Our research and development efforts concentrate on developing more innovative solutions such as economical and commercially suitable light interference 

16


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


pigments, color separation filters and various components for optical systems, and components and modules to serve the display and instrumentation markets. 

        In response to the economic downturn, we have reduced our research and development expenditures. Our total number of employees engaged in research and development has decreased to 674 as of June 30, 2003, compared to 1,240 at June 30, 2002 and 2,350 as of June 30, 2001. In addition, as part of our Global Realignment Program, we have and will continue to eliminate overlapping product development programs concentrating our key product development activities in specific global centers. Our goal is to allocate our resources both geographically and technologically to products and technologies that we believe will be most important to our customers.

As of June 30, 2003, these manufacturing locations have been scheduled for closure under the Global Realignment Program.    Products manufactured at these locations will be transferred to other locations. 
18


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

        Our intention is to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, although we do have some sole source supply arrangements. The loss or interruption of such arrangements could have an impact on our ability to deliver certain products on a timely basis. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

        Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products include patents, trade secrets and trademarks. Because of the rapidly changing technology and a broad distribution of patents in our industry, our intention is not to rely primarily on intellectual property rights to protect or establish our market position. We do not intend to broadly license our intellectual property rights unless we can obtain adequate consideration or enter into acceptable patent cross-license agreements. As of June 30, 2003, we held 849 U.S. patents and 400 foreign patents. 

Backlog 

        Backlog consists of written purchase orders for products for which we have assigned shipment dates within the following 12 months. As of June 30, 2003, our backlog was approximately $90.5 million as compared to $178.7 million at June 30, 2002. Orders in backlog are firm, but are subject to customers' cancellation or rescheduling. Because of possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders, and because our sales will often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter in which they are received, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. As a result of the current economic uncertainty, our ability to translate our backlog into sales has been and is likely to continue to be adversely affected by order cancellation and rescheduling, which were significant in recent quarters. Consequently, during this period of industry uncertainty, we caution that our announced backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future sales or the level of future orders. 

Employees 

        We had 5,489 employees as of June 30, 2003, as compared to 9,222 and 19,948 as of June 30, 2002 and June 30, 2001, respectively. The reduction in our workforce was primarily a result of the Global Realignment Program. Our workforce as of June 30, 2003 included 3,962 employees in manufacturing, 674 employees in research and development, 516 employees in general and administrative functions (including information technology, finance and human resources), and 337 employees in sales and marketing. 

        Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining organization except for our operations in France, Germany and the Netherlands. We have never experienced a work stoppage, slowdown or strike. Notwithstanding the current economic slowdown, we consider our employee relations generally to be good. 

        Similar to other technology companies, particularly those located in Silicon Valley, we rely upon our ability to use stock options and other forms of equity-based compensation as key components of our executive and employee compensation structure. Historically, these components have been critical to our ability to retain important personnel and offer competitive compensation packages. Without these components, we would be required to significantly increase cash compensation levels (or develop alternative compensation structures) in order to retain our key employees, particularly as and when an industry recovery returns. Recent proposals to modify accounting rules relating to the expensing of equity compensation may require us to substantially reduce, or even eliminate, all or portions of our equity compensation programs.

Risk Factors 

The continuing unstable economic environment has significantly harmed and may continue to significantly harm our industries 

Our sales levels are unstable, we are not currently profitable, and we have difficulty predicting future operating results 

        As a result of continuing unfavorable economic and market conditions, particularly in the communications sector (but also in our non-communications business), our sales have declined significantly from historic levels, we are not currently profitable, and we are unable to predict future sales accurately or to provide long-term guidance for future financial performance. Historically, our communications business was the more affected business; however, recently, these unfavorable conditions are increasingly impacting our non-communications businesses. The conditions contributing to this difficulty include: 

•
uncertainty regarding the capital spending plans of the major telecommunications carriers, upon which our telecommunications systems manufacturing customers, and ultimately we, depend for a substantial amount of our sales; 


•
the weakened financial condition of many major telecommunications carriers and their current limited access to the capital required for expansion; 


•
continued reduction in inventory levels by our telecommunications systems manufacturing customers; 


•
limited visibility regarding the long-term demand for high content, high speed, broadband telecommunications networks; 


•
excess fiber and channel capacity, particularly in the long-haul market, which historically has been responsible for a major portion of our communications sales and profits; 


•
uncertainty regarding the growth and profitability of the security display and commercial laser markets, which are responsible for a substantial portion of our non-communications sales and profits; and 


•
general market and economic uncertainty. 
        Based on these and other factors, many of our major customers have reduced, modified, cancelled or rescheduled orders for our products and have expressed uncertainty as to their future requirements. In the communications business, this uncertainty is reflected in the limited and highly variable forecasts our customers are providing of their anticipated needs for our communications products. As a result, our net sales in the future are likely to fluctuate and may, in fact, decline, and we anticipate that we will continue to be unprofitable in the near future. In addition, due to our current limited ability to provide long-term guidance for our operating results, our ability to meet financial expectations for future periods may be harmed. 

Our customers' businesses have been harmed by the economic downturn 

        Our communications business is largely dependent upon product sales to telecommunications systems manufacturers who in turn are dependent for their business upon sales of fiberoptic systems to telecommunications carriers. All of our systems manufacturing customers and their carrier customers have experienced severe business declines during the current downturn. Many of these companies are currently operating at losses and are unable to make meaningful long-term predictions for their recovery, and hence their forecasted requirements for optical telecommunications systems. This continuing uncertainty means that, as a supplier of the components and modules for these systems, our ability to predict our financial results or business prospects for future periods is severely limited.

Our Global Realignment Program may be unsuccessful in aligning our operations to current market conditions 

        In response to economic slowdown and as part of our continuing integration efforts, we commenced a Global Realignment Program in April 2001, under which we are, among other things: 

•
eliminating some product development programs and consolidating or curtailing others in order to focus our research and development investments on the most promising projects; 


•
consolidating our manufacturing facilities from multiple sites into single locations, as well as consolidating sales and administrative functions; 


•
aligning our sales organization to offer customers a single point of contact for all of their product requirements, and creating regional and technical centers to streamline customer interaction with product line managers. 
        Implementation of the Global Realignment Program involves major reductions in our workforce and facilities and, in certain instances, the relocation of products, technologies and personnel. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs (including cash expenditures) to implement the Global Realignment Program and we expect to realize significant future cost savings as a result. The Global Realignment Program may not be successful in achieving the expected cost reductions or other benefits, may be insufficient to align our operations with customer demand and the changes affecting our industry, or may be more costly or extensive than currently anticipated. Even if the Global Realignment Program is successful and meets our current cost reduction goals, our sales must increase substantially in the future for us to be profitable. 

Our cost reduction programs may be insufficient to achieve long-term profitability 

        We are undertaking cost reduction measures, under and in addition to the Global Realignment Program, intended to reduce our expense structure at both the cost of goods sold and the operating expense levels. We believe these measures are a necessary response to, among other things, declining average sales prices across our product lines. These measures may be unsuccessful in creating profit margins sufficient to sustain our current operating structure and business. 

We have incurred, and may in the future incur, inventory-related charges, the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately 

        As a result of the business downturn and declining demand for our products, we have written down a substantial portion of our inventory as our sales forecasts continued to decline. We generally use a rolling six-month forecast based on anticipated product orders, product order history, forecasts and backlog to assess our inventory requirements. However, as discussed above, our ability to forecast our customers' needs for our products in the current economic environment is very limited. Consequently, we have incurred, and may in the future incur, charges to write down our inventory. We recorded charges of $56.1 million and $203.9 million related to excess and obsolete inventory during fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. We may incur such inventory write-downs in future periods. Moreover, because of our current difficulty in forecasting overall sales, we may in the future revise our previous forecasts, which could lead to further inventory write-downs. While we believe, based on current information, that the amount recorded for inventory is properly reflected on our balance sheet at June 30, 2003, if market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts, our future sales mix differs from our forecasted sales mix, or actual demand from our customers is lower than our estimates, we may be required to record additional inventory write-downs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Any failure of our major telecommunications systems manufacturing customers, or their telecommunications carrier customers, to service their debt would materially harm our business 

        During the rapid growth in the telecommunications sector in the mid-to-late 1990s, telecommunications systems manufacturers and their telecommunications carrier customers incurred large amounts of debt in order to finance the expansion that was then forecasted. In the rapid downturn that followed, both capital spending and revenue declined, but debt remained and in some instances increased. As a result, several of the telecommunications carriers and, in turn their suppliers, our telecommunications systems manufacturing customers, continue to have significant amounts of outstanding debt. The servicing of this debt may, among other things, limit the carriers' ability to buy new capital equipment and, thus, the demand for telecommunications systems. In fact, several carriers (WorldCom and Global Crossing, among others) have declared bankruptcy over the past two years, or are otherwise in financial distress. We anticipate that some or all of these companies will need to repay or restructure significant portions of their debt in the future. Any failure in this task could materially harm their businesses, and consequently ours. As long as these companies are focused on debt concerns, they are less likely to acquire telecommunications systems. 

If our customers fail to meet their financial obligations to us, our business will suffer 

        Although we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and manage and monitor balances owed us, we are not able to predict changes in their financial condition, particularly during the current economic environment. Based on our estimates as to the quality of our accounts receivable, we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments. However, if our customers are unable to meet their financial obligations to us as a result of bankruptcy or deterioration in their operating results or financial condition, our trade receivables may not be recoverable and, in addition to not receiving the amounts owed, we may be required to record additional bad debt expenses, which could materially affect our financial condition and operating results. 

        Moreover, the continuing economic slowdown has exacerbated our vulnerability to demand fluctuations for our communications products. Specifically, we have experienced and remain vulnerable to material order cancellations, modifications and reschedulings, all of which, among other things, reduce our sales and impair our ability to achieve financial targets and predict financial results for future periods. 

We depend on recovery and long-term growth in our markets for our success 

If the Internet does not continue to grow as expected, our business will suffer 

        Our future success as a manufacturer of optical components, modules and subsystems ultimately depends on the continued growth of the communications industry, and, in particular, the growth of the Internet as a global communications system. As part of that growth, we are relying on increasing demand for high-content voice, text and other data delivered over high-speed connections (i.e., high bandwidth communications). As Internet usage and bandwidth demand increase, so does the need for advanced optical networks to provide the required bandwidth. Without Internet and bandwidth growth, the need for our advanced communications products, and hence our future growth as a manufacturer of these products, is jeopardized. Currently, while generally increasing demand for Internet access is apparent, less evident is when order capacity will be absorbed. Moreover, multiple service providers compete to supply the existing demand. Also, currently, fiberoptic networks have significant excess capacity. The combination of a large number of service providers and excess network capacity has resulted in severely depressed prices for bandwidth. Until pricing recovers, service providers have less incentive to install equipment and, thus, little need for many of our communications products. 

24


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ultimately, should long-term expectations for Internet growth and bandwidth demand not be realized, our business would be significantly harmed. 

We depend on stability or growth in the markets for our products outside communications for growth in the sales of this group of products 

        The growth of our display products, light interference pigment and other businesses served out of our Thin Film Products Group, depends significantly on the continued stability or growth and success of these markets. Among other things, advances in the technology used in computer monitors, televisions, conference room projectors and other display devices have led to increased demand for flat panel displays and projection displays. We cannot be certain that growth in these markets will continue. In recent periods, we have experienced reduced demand for some of our non-communications products, particularly our display components sold to Texas Instruments. We expect this reduced demand to continue for the near term. Among other things, we are working to develop additional profitable applications for our interference pigments and display components and modules. If we fail, these businesses will suffer. Moreover, we cannot predict the impact of technological or other changes in these industries on our business. In addition, each of our non-communications industries is subject to pricing pressure, consolidation and realignment as industry participants react to shifting customer requirements and overall demand. There is a risk that any consolidation or realignment could adversely affect our business, and pricing pressure can adversely affect our operating results. 

Our business and financial condition could be harmed by our long-term growth strategy 

If we fail to manage or anticipate our long-term growth, our business will suffer 

        Notwithstanding the recent decline, the optical businesses as well as the businesses that we serve out of the Thin Film Products group have historically grown, at times rapidly, and we have grown accordingly. We have made and, although we remain in an industry slowdown, expect in the future to make significant investments to enable our future growth through, among other things, internal expansion programs, product development, acquisitions and other strategic relationships. If we fail to manage or anticipate our future growth effectively, particularly during periods of industry decline, our business will suffer. Through our Global Realignment Program and other cost reductions measures we are balancing the need to shrink our operations consistent with the current economic conditions with the need to preserve our ability to grow and scale our operations when our markets recover. If we fail to achieve this balance, our business will suffer to the extent our resources and operations are insufficient to respond to a return to growth. 

If we fail to commercialize new product lines, our business will suffer 

        We intend to continue to develop new product lines and improve existing ones to meet our customers' diverse and changing needs. New product development activities are expensive, with no guarantee of success. Risks associated with our development of new products and improvements to existing products include the risk that: 

•
we may fail to complete the development of a new or improved product; 


•
our customers may not purchase the new or improved product because, among other things, the product is too expensive, is defective in design, manufacture or performance, is uncompetitive, or because the product has been superceded by another product or technology; or 


•
we may fail to anticipate or respond to new technologies that could have a disruptive impact on our business. 


        Nonetheless, if we fail to successfully develop and introduce new products and improve existing ones, our business will suffer. We have considerably reduced our research and development spending 

25


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

from historic levels and some of our competitors now spend considerably higher percentages of their revenues on research and development than do we. 

        Furthermore, new products require increased sales and marketing, customer support and administrative effort to support anticipated increased levels of operations. We may not be successful in creating this infrastructure, or we may not realize increased sales sufficient to offset the additional expenses resulting from this increased infrastructure. In connection with our many acquisitions, we have incurred expenses in anticipation of developing and selling new products. Our operations may not achieve levels sufficient to justify the increased expense levels associated with these new businesses. 

Changes in accounting rules have had and may continue to have a material effect on our financial results 

Our financial results could be affected by potential changes in the accounting rules governing the recognition of stock-based compensation expense 

        We measure compensation expense for our employee stock compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." Under this method, we recognized compensation charges related to stock compensation plans of $50.9 million, $124.9 million and $52.6 million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," we provide disclosures of our operating results as if the fair value method of accounting had been applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we provide such disclosures in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q in accordance with SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure." Had we accounted for our compensation expense under the fair value method of accounting prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the charges would have been significantly higher than the intrinsic value method used by us, totaling $685.2 million, $688.9 million and $566.2 million during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Currently, the FASB is considering changes to accounting rules concerning the recognition of stock option compensation expense. If these proposals are implemented, we and other companies may be required to measure compensation expense using the fair value method, which would adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our losses by the additional amount of such stock option charges. 

Implementation of FASB Interpretation No. 46 could affect our financial results 

        In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51," which requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests (primary beneficiary) in a variable interest entity to consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the entity. A variable interest entity is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity's activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties. Interpretation No. 46 is applicable: (i) immediately for all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003; or (ii) in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003 for those created before February 1, 2003. 

        The Company is currently reviewing its cost and equity method investments and other variable interests acquired prior to February 1, 2003 to determine whether those entities are variable interest entities and, if so, if the Company is the primary beneficiary of any of its investee companies. At June 30, 2003, the Company had 23 cost and equity method investments primarily in privately held companies and venture funds that have the potential to provide strategic technologies and relationships to the Company's businesses. The Company expects to complete the review during the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Provided the Company is not the primary beneficiary, the Company's maximum exposure to loss for these investments at June 30, 2003 is limited to the carrying amount of its investment of $37.6 million in such entities and its minimum funding commitments of $21.4 million. The consolidation 

26


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


of any investee companies under Interpretation No. 46 could adversely affect the financial position and results of operations of the Company. 

Our total net sales are dependent upon a few key customers 

        A few large customers account for most of our total net sales. During fiscal 2003, Texas Instruments accounted for 12% of our total net sales. During fiscal 2002, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales. During fiscal 2001, Nortel, Alcatel and Lucent accounted for 14%, 12% and 10% of our total net sales, respectively. We expect that, for the foreseeable future, sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account, alone or in the aggregate, for a high percentage of our total net sales. Dependence on a limited number of customers exposes us to the risk that order reductions from any one customer can have a material adverse effect on periodic revenue. In fiscal 2003, we experienced a dramatic decline in our sales to Texas Instruments, from $23.5 million (15% of quarterly revenue) in the second quarter of the year to $14.4 million (less than 10% of quarterly revenue) in the fourth quarter of the year. Moreover, many of our customers are currently experiencing significant revenue declines and, in recent periods, have significantly reduced their orders from us. If such reductions continue, our business will continue to be harmed. 

Any failure to remain competitive would harm our operating results 

If we are not competitive, our operating results could suffer 

        The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing and converging technologies. We face intense competition from established competitors and the threat of future competition from new and emerging companies in all aspects of our business. Among our current competitors are some of our customers, who are vertically integrated and either manufacture and/or are capable of manufacturing some or all of the products we sell to them. In addition to our current competitors, we expect that new competitors providing niche, and potentially broad, product solutions will increase in the future. While the current economic downturn has reduced the overall level of business in our industries, the competition remains fierce. To remain competitive in both the current and future business climates, we believe we must maintain a substantial commitment to research and development, improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations, and streamline our marketing and sales efforts, as well as customer service and support. Under our Global Realignment Program, we have ongoing initiatives in each of these areas. However, our efforts to remain competitive as we continue to implement our Global Realignment Program may be unsuccessful. Among other things, we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investments necessary to remain competitive, or we may not make the technological advances necessary to remain competitive. In addition, notwithstanding our efforts, technological changes, manufacturing efficiencies or development efforts by our competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive. 

        In the telecommunications industry, our telecommunications systems manufacturing customers evaluate our products and competitive products for deployment in their telecommunications systems. Similarly, telecommunications carrier customers evaluate our customers' system products and competitive products for system installation. Any failure of us to be selected by our customers, or our customers to be selected by their customers, can significantly harm our business. 

        The businesses we serve through our Thin Film Products Group (e.g., display, medical/environmental instrumentation, document security, product security, aerospace and defense, and lasers) are also susceptible to changing technologies and competition. Growth in the demand for our products within these markets will depend upon our ability to compete with providers of lower cost, higher performance products by developing more cost-effective processes and improving our products. Currently, we are working to develop new products for use in the commercial laser and flat panel display markets, markets with significant existing and developing competition. Our success or failure in 

27


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


these efforts will have a material impact on our non-communications business. In the security market, we face competition from alternative anti-counterfeiting devices such as holograms, embedded threads and watermarks. 

The telecommunications industry is consolidating 

        The telecommunications industry is consolidating and we believe it will continue to consolidate in the future as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry. The recent consolidations of Bookham and Nortel Network's optical components business and of Avanex and Corning's and Alcatel's respective optical components businesses are recent examples of high profile consolidations. We anticipate that consolidation will continue as a result of the current industry downturn. In addition, industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors who are able to compete better as sole-source vendors for customers. This could harm our business as we compete to be a single-vendor solution. 

        We also expect consolidation to occur among our telecommunications systems manufacturing customers and their telecommunications carrier customers. Consolidation at either level could result in, among other things, greater negotiating power for the consolidated companies with their suppliers in response to reduced competition, and reduced overall demand for telecommunications systems as the number of companies installing systems or providing services declines. Any of these results could reduce demand for our telecommunications products and increase pressure to reduce our prices and provide other concessions. 

Average selling prices are declining 

        Prices for telecommunications fiberoptic products generally decline over time as new and more efficient components and modules with increased functionality are developed, manufacturing processes improve and competition increases. The current economic environment has exacerbated the general trend, as declining sales have forced telecommunications carriers and their suppliers to reduce costs, leading to increasing pricing pressure on our competitors and us. Weakened demand for optical components and modules has created an oversupply of these products, which has increased pressure on us to reduce our prices. To the extent this oversupply is not resolved in future periods, we anticipate continuing pricing pressure. Moreover, currently, fiberoptic networks have significant excess capacity. Industry participants disagree as to the amount of this excess capacity. However, to the extent that there is significant overcapacity and this capacity is not profitably utilized in future periods, we expect to face additional pressure to reduce our prices. Also, numerous telecommunications carriers (WorldCom and Global Crossing, among others) have declared bankruptcy over the past two years or are otherwise in financial distress. As carriers are eliminated from the marketplace, through bankruptcy or consolidation, system vendors lose customers, while remaining carriers are able to increase price pressures on system vendors since vendors have fewer customer alternatives. System vendors in turn will apply those pressures on us. 

        We are also experiencing pricing pressure in the businesses we serve through our Thin Film Products Group (e.g., display, medical/environmental instrumentation, document security, product security, aerospace and defense, and lasers), as a result of improved internal sourcing capabilities within some of our customers, declining demand for some of our products and increased competition. 

        In response to declining average sales prices, we are undertaking cost reduction measures, under and in addition to the Global Realignment Program, intended to reduce our expense structure at both the cost of goods sold and the operating expense levels. These measures may be unsuccessful in creating profit margins sufficient to sustain our current operating structure and business. In addition to direct cost cutting, we must continue to: (i) timely develop and introduce new products that incorporate features that enable such products to be less price sensitive, and (ii) increase the efficiency of our 

28


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


manufacturing operations. Failure to do so could cause our sales and profit margins to further decline, which would harm our business. 

If we fail to attract and retain key personnel, our business could suffer 

        Our future depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for highly skilled technical people is extremely intense, and, the current economic environment notwithstanding, we continue to face difficulty identifying and hiring qualified engineers in many areas of our business. We may not be able to hire and retain such personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Our future also depends on the continued contributions of our executive management team and other key management and technical personnel, each of whom would be difficult to replace. The loss of services of these or other executive officers or key personnel or the inability to continue to attract qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

        As a consequence of the current economic environment and as part of our Global Realignment Program, we have reduced our global workforce to 5,489 employees as of June 30, 2003. We cannot predict the impact our recent workforce reductions and any other reductions we are compelled to make in the future will have on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. 

        Similar to other technology companies, particularly those located in Silicon Valley, we rely upon our ability to use stock options and other forms of equity-based compensation as key components of our executive and employee compensation structure. Historically, these components have been critical to our ability to retain important personnel and offer competitive compensation packages. Without these components, we would be required to significantly increase cash compensation levels (or develop alternative compensation structures) in order to retain our key employees, particularly as and when an industry recovery returns. Recent proposals to modify accounting rules relating to the expensing of equity compensation may cause us to substantially reduce, or even eliminate, all or portions of our equity compensation programs. 

We have concerns regarding the manufacturing, quality and distribution of our products 

If we do not achieve acceptable manufacturing volumes, yields and costs, our business will suffer 

        Our success depends upon our ability to timely deliver products to our customers at acceptable volume and cost levels. The manufacture of our products involves highly complex and precise processes, requiring production in highly controlled and clean environments. Changes to our manufacturing processes or those of our suppliers, or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by our suppliers or us, could significantly hurt our ability to meet our customers' product volume and quality needs. Moreover, in some cases, existing manufacturing techniques, which involve substantial manual labor, may not achieve the volume or cost targets necessary to be competitive. In these cases, we will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques, which are anticipated to involve higher levels of automation, to achieve these targets, and we will need to undertake other efforts to reduce manufacturing costs. Currently, we are devoting significant funds and other resources to: (i) develop advanced manufacturing techniques to improve product volumes and yields and reduce costs, and (ii) realign some of our product manufacturing facilities to locations offering optimal labor costs. These efforts may not be successful. If we fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields, volumes and costs, our business will be harmed. 

If our customers do not qualify our manufacturing lines for volume shipments, our operating results could suffer 

        Customers will not purchase any of our products, other than limited numbers of evaluation units, prior to qualification of the manufacturing lines for the products. Each new manufacturing line must go 

29


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


through rigorous qualification with our customers. The qualification process can be lengthy and is expensive, with no guarantee that any particular product qualification process will lead to profitable product sales. Moreover, we are currently consolidating our worldwide manufacturing operations into centralized locations, such as our facilities in Shenzhen, China. Among other things, we are moving the manufacturing of some of our products to other facilities. We expect that consolidation and product relocations may continue for the forseable future. The manufacturing lines for relocated products must undergo qualification before commercial shipment of these products can recommence. The qualification process, whether for new products or in connection with the relocation of manufacturing of current products, determines whether the manufacturing line achieves the customers' quality, performance and reliability standards. Our expectations as to the time periods required to qualify (or requalify) a product line and ship products in volumes to customers may be erroneous. Delays in qualification can cause a product to be dropped from a long-term supply program. These delays will also impair the expected timing, and may impair the expected amount, of sales of the affected products. Nevertheless, we may, in fact, experience delays in obtaining qualification of our manufacturing lines and, as a consequence, our operating results and customer relationships would be harmed. 

If our products fail to perform, our business will suffer 

        Our business depends on manufacturing excellent products of consistently high quality. Our products are highly complex and, as such susceptible to design and manufacturing defects. To guard against this, our products are rigorously tested for quality both by our customers and us. Nevertheless, our customers' testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons (including, among others, the occurrence of performance problems that are unforeseeable in testing or that are detected only when products are fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions), our products may fail to perform as expected. Failures could result from faulty design or problems in manufacturing. In either case, we could incur significant costs to repair and/or replace defective products under warranty, particularly when such failures occur in installed systems. We have experienced such failures in the past and remain exposed to such failures, as our products are widely deployed throughout the world in multiple demanding environments and applications. In some cases, product redesigns or additional capital equipment may be required to correct a defect. We have in the past increased our warranty reserves and have incurred significant expenses relating to certain communications products. Any significant product failure could result in lost future sales of the affected product and other products, as well as customer relations' problems, litigation and damage to our reputation. 

Certain of our non-telecommunications products are subject to governmental and industry regulations, certifications and approvals 

        The commercialization of certain of the products we design, manufacture and distribute through our Thin Film Products Group may be delayed or made more costly due to required government and industry approval processes. Development of applications for our light interference pigment products may require significant testing that could delay our sales. For example, certain uses in cosmetics may be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, which has extensive and lengthy approval processes. Durability testing by the automobile industry of our pigments used with automotive paints can take up to three years. If we change a product for any reason including technological changes or changes in the manufacturing process, prior approvals or certifications may be invalid and we may need to go through the approval process again. If we are unable to obtain these or other government or industry certifications in a timely manner, or at all, our operating results could be adversely affected. 

30


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We may not be able to enter into necessary strategic alliances to effectively commercialize our products 

        We often rely on strategic alliances with other companies to commercialize some of our products in a timely or effective manner, primarily in our non-telecommunication businesses. Our current strategic alliance partners provide us with assistance in the marketing, sales and distribution of a diverse line of products. We may be unable to find appropriate strategic alliances in markets in which we have little experience, which could prevent us from bringing our products to market in a timely manner, or at all. For instance, we have a strategic alliance with SICPA, one of our major customers in the Thin Film Products Group, for the marketing and sale of our light interference pigments used to provide security features in currency. Under a license and supply agreement, we rely exclusively on SICPA to market and sell to this market worldwide. SICPA has the right to terminate the agreement if we breach it. If SICPA terminates our agreement or if it is unable to market and sell our light interference pigments successfully for the applications covered by the agreement, our business may be harmed and we may be unable to find a substitute marketing and sales partner or develop these capabilities ourselves. Also, if SICPA fails to meet its minimum purchase requirements under the agreement for any reason, our operating results would be adversely affected. 

If our contract manufacturers fail to deliver quality products at reasonable prices and on a timely basis, our results of operations and financial conditions could be harmed 

        We are increasing our use of contract manufacturers as an alternative to our own manufacturing of products. If these contract manufacturers do not fulfill their obligations to us, or if we do not properly manage these relationships and the transition of production to these contract manufacturers, our existing customer relationships may suffer. In addition, by undertaking these activities, we run the risk that the reputation and competitiveness of our products and services may deteriorate as a result of the reduction of our control over quality and delivery schedules. We also may experience supply interruptions, cost escalations and competitive disadvantages if our contract manufacturers fail to develop, implement or maintain manufacturing methods appropriate for our products and customers. 

        Our supply chain and manufacturing process relies on accurate forecasting to provide us with optimal margins and profitability. Because of market uncertainties, forecasting is becoming much more difficult. In addition, as we come to rely more heavily on contract manufacturers, we may have fewer personnel resources with expertise to manage these third-party arrangements. 

Interruptions affecting our key suppliers could disrupt production, compromise our product quality and adversely affect our sales 

        We obtain various components included in the manufacture of our products from single or limited source suppliers. A disruption or loss of supplies from these companies or price increases for these components would materially harm our results of operations, product quality and customer relationships. For example, we currently utilize a sole source for the crystal semiconductor chip sets incorporated in our solid-state microlaser products. We obtain lithium niobate wafers, gallium arsenide wafers, specialized fiber components and some lasers used in our telecommunications products primarily from limited source suppliers. These materials are important components of certain of our products and we currently do not have alternative sources for such materials. Also, we do not currently have long-term or volume purchase agreements with any of these suppliers, and these components may not in the future be available at reasonable prices in the quantities required by us, if at all, in which case our business could be materially harmed. 

31

We face risks related to our international operations and sales 

        Our customers are located throughout the world. In addition, we have significant offshore operations, including manufacturing, sales and customer support operations. Our operations outside North America include facilities in Europe and Asia-Pacific. 

        Our international presence exposes us to certain risks, including the following: 

•
our ability to comply with the customs, import/export and other trade compliance regulations of the countries in which we do business, together with any unexpected changes in such regulations; 


•
tariffs and other trade barriers; 


•
political, legal and economic instability in foreign markets, particularly in those markets in which we maintain manufacturing and research facilities; 


•
difficulties in staffing and management; 


•
language and cultural barriers; 


•
seasonal reductions in business activities in the countries where our international customers are located; 


•
integration of foreign operations; 


•
longer payment cycles; 


•
greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection; 


•
currency fluctuations; and 


•
potential adverse tax consequences. 
        Net sales to customers outside North America accounted for 30%, 26% and 32% of our total net sales in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We expect that sales to customers outside North America will continue to account for a significant portion of our total net sales. Lower sales levels that typically occur during the summer months in Europe and some other overseas markets may materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, sales of many of our customers depend on international sales and consequently further expose us to the risks associated with such international sales. 

        The international dimensions of our operations and sales subject us to a myriad of domestic and foreign trade regulatory requirements. As part of our ongoing integration program, we are evaluating our current trade compliance practices and implementing improvements, where necessary. Among other things, we are auditing our product export classification and customs procedures and are installing trade information and compliance systems using our global enterprise software platforms. We do not currently expect the costs of such evaluation or the implementation of any resulting improvements to have a material adverse effect on our operating results or business. However, our evaluation and related implementation are not yet complete and, accordingly, the costs could be greater than expected and such costs and the legal consequences of any failure to comply with applicable regulations could affect our business and operating results. 

We are increasing manufacturing operations in China, which expose us to risks inherent in doing business in China 

        As a result of our Global Realignment Program and in an effort to reduce costs, we have increased our manufacturing operations in China and those operations are subject to greater political, legal and economic risks than those faced by our other operations. In particular, the political, legal and economic climate in China (both at national and regional levels) is extremely fluid and unpredictable. Among other things, the legal system in China (both at the national and regional levels) remains highly 

32


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


underdeveloped and subject to change, with little or no prior notice, for political or other reasons. Our ability to operate in China may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese laws and regulations, such as those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, intellectual property and other matters. Moreover, the enforceability of applicable existing Chinese laws and regulations is uncertain. These concerns are exacerbated for foreign businesses, such as ours, operating in China. Our business could be materially harmed by any changes to the political, legal or economic climate in China or the inability to enforce applicable Chinese laws and regulations. 

        Currently, we operate manufacturing facilities located in Shenzhen, Fuzhou and Beijing, China. As part of our Global Realignment Program and in an effort to reduce costs, we continue to increase the scope and extent of our manufacturing operations in our Shenzhen facilities. Accordingly, we expect that our ability to operate successfully in China will become increasingly important to our overall success. As we continue to consolidate our manufacturing operations, we will incur additional costs to transfer product lines to the facilities located in China, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 

        We expect to export the majority of the products manufactured at our facilities in China. Accordingly, upon application to and approval by the relevant government authorities, we will not be subject to certain of China's taxes and are exempt from customs duties on imported components or materials and exported products. We are required to pay income taxes in China, subject to certain tax relief. We may become subject to other taxes in China or may be required to pay customs duties and export license fees in the future. In the event that we are required to pay other taxes, customs duties and export license fees in China, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

Our business could be adversely affected by certain unexpected catastrophic events 

We may encounter natural disasters, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

        Our U.S. headquarters, including some of our research and development and manufacturing facilities, are located in California near major earthquake faults. Any damage to our facilities in California or other locations as a result of an earthquake, fire or any other natural disasters could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Our business is subject to the risks of terrorist acts and acts of war 

        Terrorist acts or acts of war may disrupt our operations, as well as our customers' operations. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 created many economic and political uncertainties, and intensified the global economic downturn. Any future terrorist activities could further weaken the global economy and create additional uncertainties, forcing our customers to further reduce their capital spending or cancel orders from us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Our business and operations would suffer in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure 

        We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. We are constantly updating our information technology infrastructure. Among other things, we recently unified most of our manufacturing, accounting, sales and human resource data systems using an Oracle platform, and we have entered into an agreement with Oracle to provide and maintain our global ERP infrastructure on an outsourced basis. Any failure to manage, expand and update our information technology infrastructure or any failure in the operation of this infrastructure could harm our business. 

33


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        Despite our implementation of security measures, our systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could harm our business. In addition, we may be required to spend additional costs and other resources to protect us against damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. 

If we have insufficient proprietary rights or if we fail to protect those we have, our business would be materially harmed 

We may not obtain the intellectual property rights we require 

        Others, including academic institutions, our competitors and other large technology-based companies, hold numerous patents in the industries in which we operate. Some of these patents may purport to cover our products. In response, we may seek to acquire license rights to these or other patents or other intellectual property to the extent necessary to ensure we possess sufficient intellectual property rights for the conduct of our business. Unless we are able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, patents or other intellectual property held by others could inhibit our development of new products, impede the sale of some of our current products, or substantially increase the cost to provide these products to our customers. While in the past licenses generally have been available to us where third-party technology was necessary or useful for the development or production of our products, in the future licenses to third-party technology may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Generally, a license, if granted, includes payments by us of up-front fees, ongoing royalties or a combination of both. Such royalty or other terms could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results. We are a licensee of a number of third-party technologies and intellectual property rights and are required to pay royalties to these third-party licensors on some of our telecommunications products and laser subsystems. 

Our products may be subject to claims that they infringe the intellectual property rights of others 

        The industry in which we operate experiences periodic claims of patent infringement or other intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and, from time to time, may in the future receive notices from third parties claiming that our products infringe upon third-party proprietary rights. As the downturn in the communications industries deepened and continued over the past two years, many companies have turned to their intellectual property portfolios as an alternative revenue source. This is particularly true of companies which no longer compete with us. Many of these companies have larger, more established intellectual property portfolios than ours. Typical for a growth-oriented technology company, at any one time we generally have various pending claims from third parties that one or more of our products or operations infringe or misappropriate their intellectual property rights or that one or more of our patents are invalid. However, as economic uncertainty continues, the level of patent infringement disputes in which we are engaged and expect to be engaged for the foreseeable future has increased. While in the past the settlement and disposition of these disputes has not had a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition, this may not be the case in the future. Further, the litigation or settlement of these matters, regardless of the merit of the claims, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not we are successful. If we are unsuccessful, we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or to obtain licenses to the technology that is the subject of the litigation. We may not be successful in such development or such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Without such a license, we could be enjoined from future sales of the infringing product or products.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected 

        Our future depends in part upon our intellectual property, including trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation. We currently hold numerous U.S. patents on products or processes and corresponding foreign patents and have applications for some patents currently pending. The steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property may not adequately prevent misappropriation or ensure that others will not develop competitive technologies or products. Other companies may be investigating or developing other technologies that are similar to our own. It is possible that patents may not be issued from any application pending or filed by us and, if patents do issue, the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to deter or prohibit others from marketing similar products. Any patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Further, the rights under our patents may not provide a competitive advantage to us. In addition, the laws of some territories in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, including Europe, Asia-Pacific or Latin America, may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. 

We face certain litigation risks that could harm our business 

        We have had numerous lawsuits filed against us asserting various claims, including securities class actions and stockholder derivative actions. The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Moreover, many of the complaints filed against us do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek and we therefore are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us. While we are unable to estimate the potential damages arising from such lawsuits, certain of them assert types of claims that, if resolved against us, could give rise to substantial damages. Thus, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of one or more of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. Even if these lawsuits are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved lawsuits could seriously harm our business, financial condition and reputation. Litigation can be costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. The costs of defending these lawsuits, particularly the securities class actions and stockholder derivative actions, have been significant, will continue to be costly and may not be covered by our insurance policies. The defense of these lawsuits could also result in continued diversion of our management's time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business. 

We may have difficulty obtaining director and officer liability insurance in acceptable amounts for acceptable rates 

        Like most other public companies, we carry insurance protecting our officers and directors against claims relating to the conduct of our business. Historically, this insurance covered, among other things, the costs incurred by companies and their management to defend against and resolve claims relating to management conduct and results of operations, such as securities class action claims. These claims typically are extremely expensive to defend against and resolve. Hence, as is customary, we purchase and maintain insurance to cover some of these costs. We pay significant premiums to acquire and maintain this insurance, which is provided by third-party insurers, and we agree to underwrite a portion of such exposures under the terms of the insurance coverage. Over the last several years, the premiums we have paid for this insurance have increased substantially. One consequence of the current economic environment and decline in stock prices has been a substantial increase in the number of securities class actions and similar claims brought against public corporations and their management, including our company and certain of our current and former officers and directors. Many, if not all, of these actions and claims are, and will likely continue to be, at least partially insured by third-party insurers. Consequently, insurers providing director and officer liability insurance have in recent periods sharply increased the premiums they charge for this insurance, raised retentions (that is, the amount of liability 

35


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


that a company is required to pay to defend and resolve a claim before any applicable insurance is provided), and limited the amount of insurance they will provide. Moreover, insurers typically provide only one-year policies. 

        The insurance policies that may cover the current securities lawsuits against us have a $10 million retention. As a result, the costs we incur in defending the current securities lawsuits against us may not be reimbursed until they exceed $10 million. The policies that would cover any future lawsuits may not provide any coverage to us and may cover the directors and officers only in the event we are unable to cover their costs in defending against and resolving any future claims. In fact our current policy only covers our directors and officers and is only applicable under circumstances in which the Company is unable to or prohibited from paying claims accrued during the policy period. As a result, our costs in defending or settling any future lawsuits or paying any judgments arising therefrom could increase significantly and could materially impair the Company's financial condition. 

        Each year we negotiate with insurers to renew our director and officer insurance. Particularly in the current economic environment, we cannot assure you that in the future we will be able to obtain sufficient director and officer liability insurance coverage at acceptable rates and with acceptable deductibles and other limitations. Failure to obtain such insurance could materially harm our financial condition in the event that we are required to defend against and resolve any future or existing securities class actions or other claims made against us or our management arising from the conduct of our operations. Further, the inability to obtain such insurance in adequate amounts may impair our future ability to retain and recruit qualified officers and directors. 

Recently enacted and proposed regulatory changes may cause us to incur increased costs 

        Recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, will increase our expenses as we evaluate the implications of new rules and devote resources to respond to the new requirements. In particular, we expect to incur additional SG&A expense as we implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires management to report on, and our independent auditors to attest to, our internal controls. The compliance of these new rules could also result in continued diversion of management's time and attention, which could prove to be disruptive to normal business operations. Further, the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers, which could harm our business. 

If we fail to manage our exposure to worldwide financial and securities markets successfully, our operating results could suffer 

        We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. We often utilize derivative financial instruments to mitigate these risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable investments are floating rate and municipal bonds, auction instruments and money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. When we acquire assets denominated in foreign currencies, we usually mitigate currency risks associated with these exposures with forward currency contracts. A substantial portion of our sales, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, some of these activities are conducted in other currencies, primarily Canadian and European currencies. To protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates, we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts. The contracts reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. Actual results on our financial position may differ materially.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        We also hold investments in other public and private companies, including, among others, Nortel Networks, Adept and ADVA, and have limited funds invested in private venture funds. All three companies have experienced severe stock price declines during the economic downturn, which have greatly reduced the value of our investments, and we have written down the value of these investments as the decline in fair value was deemed to be other-than-temporary. During fiscal 2003, we have written down the value of our Adept investment to $0 and recorded impairment charges of $25.0 million. During fiscal 2002, we recorded impairment charges of $187.3 million related to Nortel and $13.9 million related to ADVA. During fiscal 2001, we recorded impairment charges of $511.8 million related to Nortel and $744.7 million related to ADVA. In addition to our investments in public companies, we have in the past and expect to continue to make investments in privately held companies for strategic and commercial purposes. For example, we had a commitment to provide additional funding of up to $21.4 million to certain venture capital investment partnerships as of June 30, 2003. In recent months several of the private companies in which we held investments have ceased doing business and have either liquidated or are in bankruptcy proceedings. If the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we will be required to write down the value of the investments, which could materially harm our results of operations or financial condition. 

If we fail to obtain additional capital at the times, in the amounts and upon the terms required, our business could suffer 

        We have devoted substantial resources for new facilities and equipment in our business operations. Currently, we are incurring substantial costs associated with restructuring our business and operations under our Global Realignment Program. Although we believe our existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements at least for the next 12 months, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing to compete effectively in our markets. We cannot precisely determine the timing and amount of such capital requirements, which will depend on several factors, including, among others, our acquisitions, the success of our Global Realignment Program and the demand for our products and products under development. Such additional financing may not be available when needed, or if available, may not be on terms satisfactory to us or may be dilutive to our stockholders. 

Our rights plan and our ability to issue additional preferred stock could harm the rights of our common stockholders 

        In February 2003, we amended and restated our Stockholder Rights Agreement and currently each share of our outstanding common stock is associated with one right. Each right entitles stockholders to purchase 1/100,000 share of our Series B Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $21. 

        The rights only become exercisable in certain limited circumstances following the tenth day after a person or group announces acquisition of or tender offers for 15% or more of our common stock. For a limited period of time following the announcement of any such acquisition or offer, the rights are redeemable by us at a price of $0.01 per right. If the rights are not redeemed, each right will then entitle the holder to purchase common stock having the value of twice the then-current exercise price. For a limited period of time after the exercisability of the rights, each right, at the discretion of our Board of Directors, may be exchanged for either 1/100,000 share of Series B Preferred Stock or one share of common stock per right. The rights expire on June 22, 2013. 

        Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 499,999 shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the powers, preferences and rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of undesignated preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without the consent of our stockholders. The preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to those of the holders of common stock. 

37


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        The issuance of Series B Preferred Stock or any preferred stock subsequently issued by our Board of Directors, under some circumstances, could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control. 

        Some provisions contained in the rights plan, and in the equivalent rights plan that our subsidiary, JDS Uniphase Canada Ltd., has adopted with respect to our exchangeable shares, may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may thereby inhibit a change in control. For example, such provisions may deter tender offers for shares of common stock or exchangeable shares, which offers may be attractive to stockholders, or deter purchases of large blocks of common stock or exchangeable shares, thereby limiting the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock or exchangeable shares over the then-prevailing market prices. 

Some anti-takeover provisions contained in our charter and under Delaware laws could hinder a takeover attempt 

        We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibiting, under some circumstances, publicly-held Delaware corporations from engaging in business combinations with some stockholders for a specified period of time without the approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding voting stock. Such provisions could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, even if such events could be beneficial, in the short-term, to the interests of the stockholders. In addition, such provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions relating to the limitations of liability and indemnification of our directors and officers, dividing our board of directors into three classes of directors serving three-year terms and providing that our stockholders can take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders. These provisions also may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of us.
