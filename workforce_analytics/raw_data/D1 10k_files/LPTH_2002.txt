ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.

GENERAL

     LightPath is a  manufacturer  of families of  high-performance  fiber-optic
collimator  and isolator  products,  GRADIUM(R)  glass lenses and other  optical
materials used to produce products that manipulate light. We operate through two
operating segments;  optoelectronics and fiber  telecommunications  ("telecom"),
and traditional  optics (e.g. lenses used in lasers,  data storage,  bar coding,
medical equipment, consumer optics, etc.). We manufacture and sell the following
types of telecom  products:  (i)  collimators,  (ii)  isolators and (iii) molded
aspheric lenses. Collimators are assemblies that are used to straighten and make
parallel diverging light as it exits a fiber. An isolator is used to prevent the
back  reflection of optical  signals that can degrade  transmitter and amplifier
performance. Molded aspheres are used in telecom applications to couple laser to
fiber,  fiber  to  fiber  and  fiber  to  other  optical  devices.  Collimators,
isolators,  molded  aspheres and other optical  components  are used  throughout
fiber optic systems.  Such systems are used by the  telecommunications  industry
with a goal of  increased  bandwidth,  through  the  development  of all optical
networks, by combining multiple light streams from individual transmissions onto
a single optical fiber.  We are also planning to develop other products  related
to the  optoelectronics  and  telecommunications  industry  through licenses and
relationships with other manufacturers. SEE "CURRENT FOCUS ON PRODUCTS" BELOW.

     LightPath was incorporated under Delaware law in June 1992 as the successor
to LightPath Technologies Limited Partnership,  a New Mexico limited partnership
(the  "Partnership"),  formed in 1989,  and its  predecessor,  Integrated  Solar
Technologies  Corporation,  a New Mexico  corporation  ("ISOTEC"),  organized in
1985.

     From our  inception  in 1985  until  June  1996,  we were  classified  as a
development stage enterprise that engaged in basic research and development. Our
initial  objective in 1985 was to improve solar energy technology by creating an
optical material that could  efficiently bend light from varying angles in order
to track the path of the sun across the sky.  During this stage, we believe that
most of our product sales were to persons evaluating the commercial  application
of GRADIUM  glass (SEE - PRODUCTS:  GRADIUM) or using the  products for research
and  development.  In 1987,  we  realized  that our early  discoveries  had much
broader  application,  and we expanded our focus to imaging optics applications.
During  fiscal  year  1997,  our  operational  focus  began to shift to  product
development and sales. We completed  numerous  prototypes for production  orders
and received  catalog  sales of standard lens  profiles.  We also began to offer
standard,  computer-based  profiles  of  GRADIUM  glass that  engineers  use for
product design.

     In fiscal year 1998,  we began to explore the  development  of products for
emerging markets such as optoelectronics,  photonics and solar due to the number
of  potential  customer  inquiries  into the  ability of GRADIUM  glass to solve
optoelectronic problems,  specifically in the areas of fiber telecommunications.
In 1998, the resolution of packaging and alignment  issues,  along with advances
made by LightChip Inc.  ("LightChip")  with WDM  equipment,  led us to develop a
strategy to enter the telecom optical components market.  This strategy is built
around automated  production of telecom  components using laser fusion and fiber
attachment  techniques we developed.  We also maintained our emphasis on optical
materials  where we gained  expertise  during the  development of GRADIUM glass.
During fiscal 1998,  sales of lenses to the traditional  optics market continued
with  increases  in sales of lenses  used in the YAG laser  market,  catalog and
distributor sales and lenses used in the wafer inspection  markets.  During this
time, we  reorganized  internally  and realigned our marketing  efforts with the
purpose  of  expanding  our  focus to  include  the  optoelectronics  and  fiber
telecommunications  markets in addition to the  traditional  optics market.  See
"Sales and Marketing - Optoelectronics and Fiber Telecommunications."

     In designing our  optoelectronic  devices,  we focused on automation of the
manufacturing  process.  Although many other manufacturers in this industry rely
on offshore  production  to control  costs,  we believe that  automation  of the

                                       2

manufacturing  process can yield  significant  costs savings over the long term.
Our patented laser fusion and fiber attachment  techniques are highly automated,
and we believe these  techniques  provided  improved  quality and flexibility to
increase  manufacturing capacity in response to growth in demand. Our automation
concept was expanded upon with our fiscal 2000 acquisition of Horizon Photonics,
Inc.  ("Horizon") where we employ the use of robotic systems in manufacturing of
isolators.

     In April 2000, we acquired  Horizon,  a California  corporation  originally
founded  in July  1997.  Horizon  utilizes  automated  production  platforms  to
manufacture  passive  optical  components  for the  telecommunications  and data
communications markets. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of Horizon for
approximately  1.4 million shares of Class A Common Stock and $1 million in cash
(an  aggregate  purchase  price of  approximately  $40.2  million,  based on the
trading price of our common stock).  Horizon  manufactures  isolator products at
their Walnut, California facility.

     In  September  2000,  we acquired  Geltech,  Inc.  ("Geltech"),  a Delaware
corporation  originally  founded  in May  1985.  Geltech  is a  manufacturer  of
precision molded aspheric optics used in the active telecom components market to
provide a highly efficient means to couple laser diodes to fibers or waveguides.
Geltech also produces lens arrays for optical  switches and other  applications.
We acquired all of the outstanding  shares of Geltech for an aggregate  purchase
price of  approximately  $28.5  million,  comprised of 822,737 shares of Class A
common stock  (valued at $27.5  million based on the trading price of our common
stock) and approximately $1 million in acquisition costs.  Geltech  manufactures
products at its facilities in Orlando,  FL. During fiscal 2002, Geltech expanded
its  manufacturing  facility,   which  will  include  integrating  some  of  the
automation techniques utilized at our other facilities.

     Our first significant dealings in the  telecommunications  segment began in
June 1997, when we announced we had joined with Invention Machine Corporation to
form a joint venture company, LightChip, to develop,  manufacture and market the
next generation of wavelength division  multiplexing  ("WDM") systems for use by
telecommunication  carriers,  CATV companies,  local area networks and wide area
networks system  integrators.  WDM systems are needed by the  telecommunications
industry  to  increase  bandwidth  by  combining  multiple  light  streams  from
individual  transmissions  onto a single optical fiber.  We formed  LightChip in
order to serve the growing metro WDM market.  Since 1998, LightChip has received
approximately  $91 million  from the issuance of common stock and four series of
convertible  preferred stock. The initial  investors  included AT&T Ventures and
LightPath.  Subsequent investors also include Morgenthaler Ventures, J.P. Morgan
Capital  and  Berkeley  International.   Our  current  percentage  ownership  of
LightChip is approximately  13% of total preferred and common shares.  LightChip
successfully  demonstrated  a WDM model and had  prototypes of several  products
available in fiscal 2000.  LightChip's  first product sales occurred in calendar
2001.   We  licensed  the  use  of  GRADIUM  glass  to  LightChip  for  specific
applications. We anticipate no short-term revenue from LightChip. In May 2002 we
wrote down our investment in LightChip by $6.3 million to reflect  pricing of an
equity  round of financing at a price per share that was lower than the carrying
value of LightPath's investment in LightChip. The telecommunications  market has
been severely  depressed and  valuations  of start up companies  have  decreased
dramatically.  If  further  funding  is at a rate  lower  than  the  cost of our
previous  investment  in  LightChip  we will  be  required  to  write  down  our
investment  to the current  market  value.  LightChip's  business is at an early
stage,  and the volatile  nature of the  telecommunications  industry  makes our
investment in LightChip subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND PRODUCTS

     We  manufacture  and sell the  following  types of  telecom  products:  (i)
collimators,  (ii) isolators and (iii) molded  aspheric lenses and (iv) modules.
We also manufacture  traditional  optics products  including:  (i) GRADIUM glass
products,  lenses,  prisms and (ii) molded aspheric lenses.  GRADIUM glass is an
optical quality glass material with varying  refractive  indices used for optics
such  as  lenses  for YAG  lasers.  Molded  aspheres  are  used  in  non-telecom
applications such as optical data storage,  high precision printing,  bar coding
and by manufacturers of medical equipment.

                                   COLLIMATORS

     We offer two product levels of collimators:

          -    collimating lenses; and
          -    standard collimators.

     COLLIMATING LENSES

     We offer two types of lenses for use in telecommunication  applications: TL
and GPX-series. Our TL-series lenses are 1.8 mm diameter collimating, rod lenses
and are available in 0.18, 0.23 and 0.25  pitch-equivalent  lenses. These lenses
have an  optional  angles  facet  to  control  back  reflection  and for ease of
assembly.  Our TL-series  lenses  provide a high degree of  collimation,  design
customization,  and have  tight  piece-to-piece  control.  Customized  TL-series
lenses with larger  diameters can provide beam diameters  greater than 2 mm. Our
GPX series  lenses are  available in a wide variety of sizes and focal  lengths.
These lenses provide high quality  aberration control and are easily customized.
They are sold  separately for assembly into  customers'  components and are also
incorporated into our large beam collimator.  These GRADIUM  collimating  lenses
can replace  homogeneous lenses with, in many cases,  immediate  improvements in
performance, repeatability and cost.

     STANDARD COLLIMATOR

     We demonstrated  our first passive  optoelectronic  product,  a single mode
fiber  collimator  assembly ("SMF  Assembly") in February 1998. Our SMF Assembly
and subsequently  improved versions of the standard  collimator which offer high
quality  performance in the areas of back  reflection and insertion  loss. It is
also more compact and we believe it can be manufactured at a significantly lower
cost than the competitive products currently available in commercial quantities.
The  collimator  is a key  element in all fiber  optic  systems,  including  WDM
equipment. Collimators straighten and make parallel, diverging light as it exits
a fiber.  Our standard  collimator  provides  high quality  performance  in back
reflection and insertion loss and can withstand in excess of 10 watts of optical
power.  This  entry  level  product  currently  used  by the  telecommunications
industry  prevents  light from  diverging as it exits a fiber,  and shepherds it
into the next piece of equipment or fiber.

                                    ISOLATORS

     We  have  developed  a  family  of  products  that  utilize  a  proprietary
micro-fixture design and robotic platform process. This automated process allows
for micro-optics to be mounted in small transferable fixtures that are processed
in arrays  and  converted  into a variety of optical  components  and  component
subsystems.  Our platform is capable of producing  products  such as  isolators,
gain flatteners, attenuators, filter assemblies, and other volume-oriented optic
assemblies for the WDM market.  To date, we are manufacturing a qualified family
of free-space,  laminate and contract-specific isolators. In 2001, we released a
new line of isolator  assemblies for application in the metro and access telecom
markets.  This  line is based on a  flexible  manufacturing  platform  which can
address a wide range of  customer  specifications  while  supporting  lower cost
applications.

     The  optical  isolator is used to prevent  the back  reflection  of optical
signals  that  can  degrade  transmitter  and  amplifier  performance.  We  have
developed  and  qualified  an  automated   platform   process  that  avoids  the
traditional pitfalls of producing optical isolators.  Applicable to a variety of
passive optical  components,  our automated platform process has proven to be an
efficient and low cost method for manufacturing isolators without machining tiny
metal  fixtures and without  utilizing a significant  level of manual labor.  We
believe our isolator has a competitive  advantage  for a certain  segment of OEM
business,  since our proprietary platform allows us to produce unique designs at
competitive prices in a flexible, automated process.

          MOLDED ASPHERES, MOLDED LENS ARRAYS AND DIFFRACTION GRATINGS

     The telecom  industry  has a need for molded  aspheres  for  laser-to-fiber
coupling, tunable lasers, DFB lasers and device coupling. Corning Inc. developed
the technology we employ for molding a proprietary low melting temperature glass
into an asphere lens. With our September 2000 acquisition of Geltech,  LightPath
obtained the process, key personnel and equipment,  and also secured a perpetual
license to all Corning's  intellectual  property associated with the development
of precision molded optics.  We have continued to refine the process and develop
the markets for aspheric lenses.

     Our focus is on providing custom optical  solutions to meet unique customer
needs in the rapidly changing telecommunications market as well as extending our
customer base in markets outside of telecom. We provide aspheric lenses of sizes
up to 15mm, and we are a developer of sub-millimeter optics.

     We have also  developed a line of molded lens arrays.  We have  developed a
process to mold lens arrays capable of producing  optical  components  with very
small lens  diameters  and very high lens density (for example,  40,000  optical
elements in a two-inch diameter array).

     Although we have a unique and  proprietary  line of  all-glass  diffraction
gratings  (StableSil(R))  for  telecom  applications,   there  currently  is  no
significant   activity  in  the  market  for  this  product  line  and  we  have
discontinued further development efforts in this area.

                                     MODULES

     We have  introduced  a number of modules  which will combine two or more of
our  current  components,  such as the  isolator  and  molded  aspheres,  into a
subassembly.  During  fiscal 2002 we began to expand  modules  offerings  and to
automate the  manufacturing  of modules to take  advantage of low cost assembly.
Current passive optical modules include the OASIS(TM) and Vectra(TM)  collimator
arrays. The expansion of these modules will continue into fiscal 2003.

                                    GRADIUM

     GRADIUM glass is an optical quality glass material with varying  refractive
indices, capable of reducing optical aberrations inherent in conventional lenses
and performing with a single lens tasks traditionally performed by multi-element
conventional  lens  systems.  We  believe  that  GRADIUM  glass  lenses  provide
advantages  over  conventional  lenses for  certain  applications.  By  reducing
optical  aberrations and the number of lenses in an optical  system,  we believe
that GRADIUM glass can provide more  efficient  light  transmission  and greater
brightness,  lower production  costs, and a simpler,  smaller product.  While we
believe that other  researchers  have sought to automate  production  of passive
optical  components  and to  produce  optical  quality  lens  material  with the
properties of GRADIUM  glass,  we are not aware of any other person or firm that
has developed a repeatable  manufacturing process comparable to our abilities or
with the ability to produce such material on a prescribable basis.

PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPMENT

     The  current  focus of our  development  efforts  has been to  develop  new
products  based  on  our  optical  and  automation  platforms  in the  areas  of
isolators,  optical subassemblies,  micro-collimators and lens arrays for use in
the telecommunications field, and other markets which use optical components.

     Our original  process patent is for producing an optical quality  material,
GRADIUM  glass,  with an "axial"  gradient  refractive  index  (i.e.,  the index
gradient runs parallel to the optical lens axis,  rather than  perpendicular  to
the lens axis or "radial").  The GRADIUM glass  designated  curve is achieved by
the  controlled  combination  of  multiple  glass  optical  densities.  We  have
developed  a set of  proprietary  software  design  tools so that the light upon
leaving the glass can be precisely modeled. GRADIUM glass lenses can be produced
across a large diameter range (currently 1mm-100mm). Growth in our manufacturing
capabilities  has led to improved  yield and  automation,  advancing our goal of
producing competitively priced products.

     We were  issued a patent  in  fiscal  year  2000 for the  development  of a
process  utilizing  high-powered  lasers for fusion,  splicing and  polishing of
optical  material  to include  optical  fiber.  This  patent is the basis of our
collimator production technology.

     We were issued our first of three patents  relating to our robotic assembly
platform  used for the  manufacturing  of isolators in fiscal year 2001 and have
several other patents in process.

     We have  approximately  50 US and foreign patents in the areas of precision
molded  optics  and  Sol-Gel  technologies.  We also hold the  right to  certain
materials we believe are key to the development of high precision molded optics.

     In addition,  we utilize other optical  materials and  specialized  optical
packaging  concepts to manipulate light and perform research and development for
optical  solutions  in  the  fiber  telecommunications  and  traditional  optics
markets.

     MODULES

     During  fiscal 2001,  we  introduced a number of modules which will combine
two or more of our current components, such as the isolator and molded aspheres,
into a subassembly.  During fiscal 2002 we began to expand modules offerings and
to automate the manufacturing of modules to take advantage of low cost assembly.
Current passive optical modules include the OASIS(TM) and Vectra(TM)  collimator
arrays.  The expansion of these  modules will continue into fiscal 2003.  Demand
for  modules  is  driven  by  specific  customer  needs.   Utilizing  automation
techniques,  we are able to provide active alignment of multiple  components and
deliver a  subsystem  optimized  for the  customers  unique  needs with very low
insertion loss.

     SWITCHES AND COLLIMATOR ARRAYS

     During fiscal 2002,  we had planned on shipment of the 1XN  opto-mechanical
switch  based  upon a patent  licensed  from  Herzel  Laor.  Due to the  current
economic environment, we elected to suspend expenditures required to launch this
product in fiscal 2002. We will  concentrate  instead on  development of further
enhancements to existing product lines.

     Using the automated  alignment  techniques learned in production of the 1XN
opto-mechanical  switch, we proceeded with the development of collimator arrays.
We  successfully  shipped  prototypes  of this product in the fourth  quarter of
fiscal 2002 and intend to expand in this area in fiscal 2003.

     SOL-GEL TECHNOLOGY

     We have developed a replication  process to manufacture  glass  diffractive
optical components using Sol-Gel technology. This process allows the fabrication
by replication of these complex optics at a fraction of the cost of conventional
technologies such as photolithography and reactive-ion  etching. In addition, we
have  produced  other  Sol-Gel  based  components   including  the  high  volume
manufacture of silica  substrates for optically active windows used in toxic gas
detection and the development and production of unique  solid-state  calibration
filters.  We have  practiced  Sol-Gel  technology  for  several  years  and have
successfully   addressed  many  different   markets  over  the  years.  We  have
significant  knowledge in this field with protection through extensive know-how,
trade secrets, and 7 issued patents.

     In 2000,  we  introduced  a line of  all-glass  gratings in response to the
anticipated demand from the  telecommunications  industry for the fabrication of
DWDM and other devices  requiring high  performance and sturdy  gratings.  These
all-glass gratings present significant advantages over available gratings due to
outstanding environmental resistance, high performance and low cost.

     Although we  continued to pursue the  development  of  additional  products
based on Sol-Gel  technology and had included in our new product plans inorganic
waveguides,  active  waveguides  and  arrayed  waveguide  gratings to be used in
telecommunications  applications,  we have delayed these development efforts due
to the  current  economic  environment.  We have  elected to delay  expenditures
required to launch these products until we see a substantial  increase in demand
from our customers and the market.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

     Our management and marketing focus historically has been organized with the
intent  of  serving  two  separate  markets:   (1)   optoelectronics  and  fiber
telecommunications  ("telecom"), and (2) traditional optics (e.g. lenses used in
lasers, data storage, bar coding, medical equipment,  consumer optics, etc.). We
believe  that GRADIUM  glass and other  optical  materials  can  potentially  be
marketed for use in many optics and optoelectronics products.

     During  the  last 18  months,  the  telecom  equipment  market  has  slowed
dramatically, including the optical components segment of the market. As service
providers  rapidly cut their capital spending  budgets,  inventories of hardware
systems,  subsystems,  and  components  grew  quickly  due to a lag  in  vendors
adjusting their build rates to the downturn in demand.  Although inventories are
believed to be dropping,  there is still a sizeable inventory of components that
must be consumed before supply and demand come back in balance.  We believe this
reduction  in demand for telecom  components  will  continue  into fiscal  2003,
therefore, we are adjusting our business plans.

     In June  2002 we  announced  plans  for  fiscal  2003  where we  intend  to
consolidate  lens product lines in Florida and reorganize  internally into three
groups;  the Optical  Lens Group;  the Laser  Component  Group;  and the Optical
Integration  Group.  The  Optical  Lens Group will  manage  the  collimator  and
aspheric lens products,  which  continues as the core  capability for LightPath.
These product lines will be consolidated in the Orlando,  Florida  facility.  We
believe the aspheric lens product line, in particular,  has broad  applicability
to  market   segments  beyond  telecom.   We  are   aggressively   pursuing  new
opportunities  in the application  areas of medical devices,  barcode  scanners,
optical data storage, machine vision, sensors, and environmental monitoring.

     In response to our customers' requirements for a second site capability and
optical  packaging  solutions,  we  intend  to  increase  our  emphasis  on  the
integrated platform segment of our business within the Laser Component Group. We
have had great success with our isolator  product line, and as our customers ask
for more demanding optical performance we see a great opportunity to provide the
entire solution from laser to fiber. The Laser Component Group will be investing
a modest amount in capital expenditures and research and development, in support
of  optical  generation  and  detection  applications,   such  as  transmitters,
transceivers  and pumps. The Optical  Integration  Group will allow LightPath to
augment  current  passive  optical  packages  such as OASIS(TM)  and  Vectra(TM)
collimator arrays with new innovative passive optical modules, such as multiport
and hybrid devices,  to provide effective optical  management  solutions for our
customers.

OPTOELECTRONICS AND FIBER TELECOMMUNICATIONS (TELECOM PRODUCTS)

     Optoelectronics  technologies  consist  of  an  overlap  of  photonics  and
electronics  and are key enablers of  "Information  Age"  technologies,  such as
fiber optic  communications,  optical  data  storage,  laser  printers,  digital
imaging,  and sensors  for  machine  vision and  environmental  monitoring.  The
telecom/datacom networks have experienced explosive growth. The dramatic rise of
the  Internet,  office  automation,  videoconferencing,   local  and  wide  area
networking,  and remote access telecommunications has fueled the demand for more
and  more  network  capacity  in both  long-haul  telecommunications  and  cable
television networks.

     Given the inherently faster speed of light signals in fiber-optic  networks
and their immunity from  electromagnetic  interference,  fiber-optic systems are
replacing existing copper wire networks for long-haul (more than 600 kilometers)
telecommunications  networks.  Cable  television  networks are also  shifting to

                                       7

fiber-optic solutions for the distribution of signals from the broadcast station
to the local cable  distribution  hubs. Today,  fiber-optic cable is the primary
medium for long-haul  telecommunications  and cable  television  networks and is
making  inroads to replace  copper in the shorter  distance  "metro  loops" that
serve larger metropolitan and other public networks with transmission  distances
of less than 100 kilometers.

     COLLIMATORS

     Prior to 1998, we targeted various optoelectronic industry market niches as
potential  purchasers of our GRADIUM glass  products.  During 1998, we began the
development of products for the emerging optoelectronics  markets,  specifically
in the areas of fiber  telecommunications.  We  demonstrated  our first  passive
optoelectronic  product, the SMF Assembly, in 1998. This product is manufactured
with automated  production  techniques we developed  which utilizes laser fusion
and fiber  attachment.  During 1999 and 2000,  we expanded  this  product  line,
demonstrating to the  telecommunication  optical components industry that we can
provide low cost products and solutions to meet their telecom-related collimator
needs.

     ISOLATORS AND WDM SYSTEMS

     The demand for increased  bandwidth in fiber-optic  networks has led to the
widespread use of a once-theoretical method for transmitting multiple signals at
slightly different  wavelengths  through a single fiber to achieve efficient use
of fiber capacity. This technique, known as wavelength division multiplexing, or
WDM, requires separate source lasers transmitting slightly different wavelengths
for each signal or "channel" and more complex  modulators and optical amplifiers
to control  and  amplify  the signal in the  network.  WDM  systems,  originally
developed for eight separate  channels in 1996, are currently  being designed to
carry  as  many  as  128   separate   channels   with  0.4  of  a  nanometer  in
differentiation between wavelengths.  In theory, a single pair of optical fibers
can carry more than 10 terabits  of  information  per  second,  which is roughly
equivalent to 156 million voice  channels or 500,000  simultaneous  two-way HDTV
channels. Through our investment in LightChip, we have positioned ourselves with
products that are designed for use within WDM systems.

     With our  acquisition  of Horizon,  we  acquired  automated  production  of
passive optical components for the  telecommunications  and data  communications
markets. We believe our primary strength is the design of optical  subassemblies
for automation.  Our team has a  comprehensive  background in the field of fiber
optics, taking research efforts "off the bench" and into manufacturing.  Drawing
upon  years of  experience  in  automation,  optoelectronic  package  design and
testing,  and a multitude of technical  disciplines,  we have demonstrated novel
solutions for today's WDM design and processing challenges. By targeting product
families  and  creating  common  platforms  for  each,  we  can  rapidly  tailor
variations within a family,  as the customer  demands,  without major process or
tooling  changes.  This philosophy is evident in our  proprietary  micro-fixture
design and automated platform manufacturing process. This platform allows robots
to mount  micro-optics in small  transferable  fixtures that can be processed at
various levels and converted into a variety of finished products. We believe our
isolator has a  competitive  advantage  for a certain  segment of OEM  business,
since  our  proprietary   platform  allows  us  to  produce  unique  designs  at
competitive prices in a flexible, automated process.

     In  fiscal  2002,  we  went  into  production  on a new  line  of  isolator
assemblies for  application in the metro and access  telecom  markets.  This new
line is based on a  flexible  manufacturing  platform  which can  address a wide
range of customer specifications while attracting lower cost applications.

     ASPHERIC LENSES

     Lenses in  telecommunications  applications perform two major tasks. One is
for the collimation of light as it emerges from the fiber. This collimated light
then passes through multiple  components  including  isolators,  filters,  and a
second collimator,  before returning back into a fiber. The second major task is
coupling light at the output of a laser diode to a fiber or waveguide.  Aspheric
lenses and lens arrays are used in both of these configurations.

     Telecom  products  manufactured  using  this  technology  include  aspheric
lenses,  sub-millimeter lenses and lens arrays.  Several new products using this
technology are under  development.  These new products include low-cost aspheric
lenses,  anamorphic lenses,  cross cylinder lenses and  multifunctional  optical
components.  All of these  products also have key  relevancy for many  different
market applications outside of the telecommunications market.

     SWITCHES

     In 1999, we entered into an exclusive  licensing agreement with Herzel Laor
for the commercialization of two fiberoptic opto-mechanical switch technologies.
In August 2000 we introduced the LP1600 opto-mechanical  switch. The LP1600 is a
1xN  optical  switch,  which  is  designed  to route  one  incoming  fiber  into
one-of-many  output fibers. The current design allows customers to select custom
configurations  of 4 to 24 output channels.  The LP1600 had patent  applications
filed and was sold in small quantities in fiscal 2002. We planned to manufacture
the  LP1600 at our  Albuquerque  locationhowever,  due to the  current  economic
environment we suspended  expenditures required to launch this product in fiscal
2002.

     OTHER PRODUCTS

     We are currently developing  additional  optoelectronics  products based on
our  proprietary  technologies.  Key strategic  alliances  with  technology  and
marketing  partners  to  design,  build  and  sell  next  generation  integrated
components  and devices may be  considered  in the  future.  However,  we do not
currently have any agreements,  other than those discussed  above, to enter into
any strategic alliances for this purpose.

TRADITIONAL OPTICS

     LASER MARKETS FOR GRADIUM LENSES

     We initially  emphasized  laser products because we believed GRADIUM lenses
could have a substantial  immediate  commercial  impact in laser products with a
relatively small initial investment. The majority of lens sales is due to optics
used by YAG lasers.  Generally,  optical  designers can  substitute our standard
GRADIUM glass components for existing laser lens elements.  Lasers are presently
used extensively in a broad range of consumer and commercial products, including
fiber  optics,  robotics,  wafer chip  inspection,  bar code  reading,  document
reproduction  and audio and video compact disc machines.  Because  GRADIUM glass
can  concentrate  light  transmission  into  a  much  smaller  focal  spot  than
conventional  lenses,  we believe,  and  customers  test results  confirm,  that
GRADIUM  glass  has the  ability  to  improve  the  current  standard  of  laser
performance.  In 1998, our  distributor,  Permanova  Lasersystems  AB of Sweden,
completed a lengthy  trial and testing  period on GRADIUM YAG lenses  which they
qualified into systems produced by Rofin-Sinar GmbH, a major OEM manufacturer of
high-powered CO2 and YAG lasers, headquartered in Germany.

     Our growth  strategy is to increase our emphasis on key laser market niches
and  establish  the necessary  products and  partnership  alliances to sell into
Europe and Asia as well as the U.S.  market.  During fiscal 1999,  LightPath and
Rodenstock  Prazisionsoptik GmbH (Rodenstock)  executed an agreement to transfer
to Rodenstock the exclusive, application-related utilization and distribution of
GRADIUM lenses  throughout  Europe.  The agreement was for an initial  five-year
period.  Rodenstock sold their precision  optics division to Linos AG, a pioneer
in the  field  of  photonics,  in  June  2000.  We  believe  our  agreement  and
relationships will continue to grow under the Linos AG/Rodenstock  alliance.  We
also have established relationships with eight additional foreign distributors.

     MOLDED ASPHERES

     Through  our  acquisition  of  Geltech,  we  purchased  the  rights  to the
Precision Molded Optics process. Our traditional optics product applications are
molded  aspheres  used in optical data storage,  high  precision  printing,  bar
coding and by manufacturers of some medical equipment.

     ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS ("OEMS")

     In addition to laser applications, through our printed and Internet on-line
catalog,  we offer a standard line of GRADIUM glass lenses for broad-based sales
to  optical  designers  developing  particular  systems  for  OEMs  or  in-house
products.  Because complex systems contain many optical components,  and GRADIUM
glass  lenses can be  utilized  to reduce the  number of lens  elements  in such
systems,  we believe  that  GRADIUM  glass  lenses can  simplify  the design and
improve  the  performance  of  complex  optical  systems.  However,  design  and
production of an optical product is a lengthy process, and it may take years for
producers to redesign  complex optical systems using GRADIUM glass,  reconfigure
the product housing,  re-engineer the assembly  process and commence  commercial
quantity orders for GRADIUM glass  components.  Accordingly,  we intend to focus
our long-term marketing efforts on emerging industries,  such as optoelectronics
and fiber  telecommunications  designed in next-generation  optical systems, and
performance  driven  industries  that are  seeking to  optimize  performance  of
existing optical products.

     We believe  OEM  relationships  may  improve  our  ability to develop  more
sophisticated technology development methods and products, although there can be
no assurances in this regard.  Such OEM relationships  have been utilized in the
development of prototype  lenses for  manufacturers of endoscopes and wafer chip
inspection equipment.  We will evaluate future OEM projects based on a number of
factors, including our assessment of the OEM's ability to fund the design effort
for the project and expected impact upon future sales.

SALES AND MARKETING

     Extensive   product  diversity  and  varying  levels  of  product  maturity
characterize  the optics  industry.  Product  markets range from consumer (e.g.,
cameras,  copiers) to industrial  (e.g.,  lasers,  data storage),  from products
where the lenses are the central  feature  (e.g.,  telescopes,  microscopes)  to
products incorporating lens components (e.g., robotics, semiconductor production
equipment).  Emerging  technology markets require optics for bandwidth expansion
and data transfer improvement in the drive to achieve an all optical network. As
a  result,  the  market  for our  products  is  highly  segmented  and no single
marketing approach will allow us to access all available market segments.

     Since fiscal 1998, our primary marketing objective has been the development
and  marketing  of passive  components  for the  optoelectronics  segment of the
telecommunications  industry  and laser based  products  in the  general  optics
product  arena.  The  narrowing  of our  product  focus was in  response  to the
opportunities  in the emerging  optoelectronics  market where we believe we have
key advantages and our success in sales of laser based products.  We believe our
key advantages are:

     -    we have developed packaging solutions for optoelectronic products;
     -    we have  been  able  to  develop  patentable  processes  with  optical
          materials that provide product solutions; and
     -    through automation, we have developed low cost production techniques.

Combining these  elements,  we believe we have the opportunity to enter into key
optical  telecommunications  markets  with  products  that are enabling and cost
effective.  Although the same design constraints and technological  shortcomings
of conventional  optical technology and materials restrict all optical products,
we believe that our  proprietary  manufacturing  processes,  as well as the high
quality associated with GRADIUM glass,  results in a competitive  advantage over
other glass  products  currently  available  in our targeted  markets.  With our
acquisitions,  we have added to our line of  passive  optical  components  while
maintaining  our emphasis on low cost production  from  automation,  and added a
product line sold into the active optical  component markets as well as products
to be sold into DWDM systems.

OPTOELECTRONICS AND FIBER TELECOMMUNICATIONS

     In order to be more  accessible to potential  customers we have divided our
sales  staff  into  the  following  territorial  areas  because  of  their  high
concentrations of telecom users:

     -    NorthWest
     -    SouthWest
     -    MidWest
     -    SouthEast
     -    NorthEast

     In  addition,  we have  formalized  relationships  with  eight  industrial,
optoelectronics and medical component  distributors located in foreign countries
to assist in distribution of telecom products outside the United States. Because
the  optics  industry  is highly  fragmented,  we utilize  distributors  and our
Internet  site  (www.lightpath.com)  as vehicles  for broader  promotion  of our
telecom  products.  We have  placed,  and will  continue  to place,  print media
advertisements  in various trade  magazines and will  participate in appropriate
domestic and foreign trade shows.

     The target market for our current  products is concentrated  within several
industry  experts such as Corning,  Inc., JDS Uniphase  Corporation  and Alcatel
Optronics.  The lens and standard collimator are used in free space applications
where coupling to an optical fiber is required.  We are developing these initial
products  into  families  of products as  variations  are made to meet  specific
customer  requirements.  Our  focus  will be on the  standard  collimator  as we
believe that the standard  collimator will replace the collimating  lens in many
applications.

     Since  many  of  our  targeted  customers   currently  assemble  their  own
collimators,  our sales  approach will be to highlight  the standard  collimator
price/performance  ratio  (value) and compare  that to the  customer's  internal
costs plus their lost  opportunity  cost.  During  fiscal  2001,  our large beam
collimator was selected as the primary customized  collimator built specifically
for Corning's  PurePath(TM)  Wavelength  Selective Switch. This product utilizes
both a GRADIUM  lens and a standard  collimator  which  takes  advantage  of the
unique properties of both components.

     Telecom  product  sales  for  fiscal  years  2002,   2001,  and  2000  were
approximately  $8.3 million,  $21.1  million,  and $1.5  million,  respectively,
primarily generated by targeting our sales efforts on collimators and isolators,
entry level products  currently  used by the  telecommunications  industry.  Our
major telecom  customers in fiscal 2002,  2001 and 2000 included  Finisar Corp.,
Agere Systems, Inc., Lucent, Inc., Corning, Inc. and JDS Uniphase Corporation.

     Our   marketing   plan  for   isolators   targets   niche  players  in  the
telecom/datacom  markets  with  high  volume  potential  for  the  next  decade.
Specifically,  we are  focusing  on  the  following  market  segments:  (i)  WDM
long-haul   system   manufacturers,   (ii)  cable   television   carrier  system
manufacturers,   (iii)  "metro  loop"  system  manufacturers,   and  (iv)  Fiber
Channel/Gigabit  Ethernet system  manufacturers.  The largest isolator customers
were Finisar Corp. with sales of approximately  $2.4 million in fiscal 2002, and
Agere Systems, Inc. ("Agere") (formerly the Microelectronics  division of Lucent
Technologies  Inc.) with sales of $11.4  million and $900,000 in fiscal 2001 and
2000,  respectively.   These  customers  represent  two  platforms:  free  space
isolators  and a  low-cost  isolator  platform  to be used in the  metro  access
markets.

     Our marketing plan for molded aspheres targets the asphere lenses used with
DFB lasers and tunable  lasers,  major customers being Alcatel and other telecom
companies.  In  addition,  we are  focusing on several  high volume  non-telecom
opportunities in defense,  medical devices,  other laser applications as well as
data storage.

     In addition to our telecom  products  business,  we are planning to provide
modules  where  several of our  components  are  integrated  with  automation to
provide a subassembly  to the customer.  We have  introduced a number of modules
which will combine two or more of our current  components,  such as the isolator
and molded aspheres,  into a subassembly.  During fiscal 2002 we began to expand

                                       11
<PAGE>
             LightPath Technologies, Inc. - Form 10K, June 30, 2002


modules offerings and to automate the manufacturing of modules to take advantage
of low cost assembly.  Current passive optical modules include the OASIS(TM) and
Vectra(TM)  collimator  arrays.  We believe  these modules have the potential to
provide higher gross profit margins than the individual components.  We are also
addressing our customers DWDM needs by focusing our development  team efforts on
a  "micro-collimator"  assembly to target  numerous  requests for  manufacturing
services related to collimating  packages.  Our micro lens array has application
in optical switching,  waveguide  coupling and fiber array coupling.  Generally,
inquiries for these products have been coming from producers of next  generation
switches,  MEMS and other optical devices  requesting  assistance with packaging
and volume production.

     STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

     WDM MODEL AND DWDM PROTOTYPES

     Since fiscal 1997,  we have entered  into  strategic  alliances  with other
companies in an effort to quickly enter into the  optoelectronics  markets.  For
example,  we currently own  approximately 13% of the preferred and common shares
outstanding of LightChip.  LightChip  successfully  demonstrated a WDM model and
DWDM  prototypes  with product sales beginning in calendar 2001. We licensed the
use of GRADIUM glass, as well as any newly developed  intellectual  property, in
the field of  fiber-optic  communication  systems,  components  and  devices  to
LightChip.  We  have  retained  the  rights  to  the  specific  areas  of  fiber
collimators,   isolators,  amplifiers,   circulators,  couplers,  splitters  and
fiber-optic switches.

     SWITCHES

     In 1999, we entered into an exclusive  licensing agreement with Herzel Laor
for the commercialization of two fiberoptic opto-mechanical switch technologies.
In August 2000 we introduced the LP1600 opto-mechanical  switch. The LP1600 is a
1xN  optical  switch,  which  is  designed  to route  one  incoming  fiber  into
one-of-many  output fibers. The current design allows customers to select custom
configurations  of 4 to 24 output  channels.  The Company planned to manufacture
the LP1600,  for which patent  applications  have been filed, at its Albuquerque
location.  Due to  the  current  economic  environment  we  elected  to  suspend
expenditures required to launch this product in fiscal 2002.

     TRADE SHOWS

     We have  displayed our product line additions and  enhancements  at various
trade  shows each year.  During the third  quarter of fiscal  2002,  the Company
announced five new products  designed for use in both long-haul and metropolitan
area  (metro)  networks  which we  displayed  at the March  2002  Optical  Fiber
Communication  Conference  ("OFC") held in Anaheim,  California.  These five new
products are examples of how we believe LightPath can provide added value to our
customers.  Each one utilizes  advanced  manufacturing  technology to `build-in'
much of the optical alignment work that was formerly  performed by the customer.
They also underscore  LightPath's  strategic directive of broadening our base of
innovative optical components and assemblies by combining  application  specific
engineering with automated manufacturing. These shows provide an opportunity for
us to meet with potential customers,  distribute  information and samples of our
products and to discuss test results from samples previously sent.

TRADITIONAL OPTICS

     Prior to our IPO in 1996,  our  resources  had been  applied  primarily  to
research and  development;  consequently,  LightPath  and GRADIUM glass were not
introduced  to the  commercial  market.  Promotion of our  products  through the
Internet,  trade  advertising  in  industrial  magazines  and  participation  in
numerous  domestic and foreign trade shows  increased  interest and awareness of
our products,  resulting in additional lens sales. Traditional optics lens sales
for fiscal  years 2002,  2001 and 2000 were  approximately  $4.2  million,  $5.1
million and $768,000,  respectively. The growth in 2001 was primarily due to the

                                       12
<PAGE>
             LightPath Technologies, Inc. - Form 10K, June 30, 2002


acquisition of Geltech's  traditional  optics business in September 2000,  which
accounted  for $4 million of  traditional  optics sales in fiscal 2001.  Asphere
products are used in data  storage and by  manufacturers  of medical  equipment.
Lens  sales  are  primarily  due to sales of lenses  for  laser  and wafer  chip
inspection markets.  Our sales efforts in targeting laser applications,  an area
where  GRADIUM  lenses  increase  the  quality of YAG laser beams and reduce the
focal spot size, has received market acceptance. Our primary customers in fiscal
2002, 2001 and 2000 included  Presstek,  Coherent,  Gerhard Franck Optronik GmBH
and Permanova Laser Systems AB.

     INDUSTRIAL AND OPTOELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTORS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES

     We have formalized  relationships  with eight industrial and optoelectronic
distributors located in foreign countries. Because the optics industry is highly
fragmented,  we utilize  distributors  and the  Internet as vehicles for broader
promotion of GRADIUM glass products.  Our Internet web site  (www.lightpath.com)
is one source of information on GRADIUM glass, and potential  customers can view
products from our catalog.  We have placed,  and will  continue to place,  print
media advertisements in various trade magazines and will participate in selected
domestic  and  foreign  trade  shows.  We have  developed  a network of selected
independent  optical  engineering  firms to promote  the sale of  GRADIUM  glass
products. Presently, eight optical engineering firms provide such optical design
services and support.

     PROMOTIONAL AND EDUCATION ACTIVITIES FOR OPTICAL DESIGNERS

     As  part  of our  marketing  strategy,  we have  provided  promotional  and
educational activities concerning GRADIUM glass and its properties,  intended to
familiarize and educate optical engineers from numerous, high performance optics
markets. We presently have six standard profiles of GRADIUM glass that engineers
can use for product  design,  and we will  continue to develop more  profiles as
required.  Our existing  GRADIUM glass profiles are compatible with  established
software design programs utilized by optical  designers,  enabling  designers to
integrate  GRADIUM  glass into their  designs.  While this enables  designers to
incorporate  GRADIUM glass into their existing product design,  we must increase
familiarity  with  GRADIUM  glass  so that  designers  will be  more  likely  to
incorporate GRADIUM glass in their original designs. If a standard GRADIUM glass
profile is not suited for a specific design,  we have the capability to create a
custom  GRADIUM  glass  profile for the  customer.  Our  objective is to educate
optical designers, through the distribution of materials, about the potential of
GRADIUM glass to provide them with additional  flexibility and design freedom to
create optical products more efficiently and with enhanced performance.

COMPETITION

OPTOELECTRONICS AND FIBER TELECOMMUNICATIONS

     The telecommunications  marketplace is renowned for its product quality and
reliability demands. Every item must pass rigorous testing before being designed
into devices and systems.  We must establish a reputation as a quality supplier.
The products  must perform as claimed so that the customer will not need to test
after the initial  qualification,  and we must be open to continuous improvement
of our  products  and  processes.  If we can pass these  tests we believe we can
become a primary  or second  source  supplier  to the  industry.  However,  this
industry  is subject to,  among other  risks,  intense  competition  and rapidly
changing  technology,  and  there  can be no  assurances  as to our  ability  to
anticipate and respond to the demands and competitive aspects of this industry.

     COLLIMATORS AND MOLDED ASPHERES

     There  are  currently  only  a  handful  of  direct   competitors  for  our
collimating  lenses  and  standard  collimator.  Nippon  Sheet  Glass  currently
supplies the majority of collimator  lenses.  The collimator  lens is a separate
business  from Nippon Sheet  Glass's  primary  product,  automotive  glass.  Our
standard collimator competes against existing collimator  assemblies,  which are
produced  by  Casix(acquired  by  JDS  Uniphase),  DiCon  Fiberoptics,   Samsung
Electronics,  Wave  Optics and Oz Optics.  There are also a number of  companies
that assemble their own  collimators,  such as Lucent,  and JDS Uniphase.  These
competitors have greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and other resources

                                       13

             LightPath Technologies, Inc. - Form 10K, June 30, 2002


than LightPath. We are aware of current research projects that integrate optical
technologies,  such as  existing  planar  waveguide  structures,  which have the
potential to replace  some of the current  collimator  applications.  We believe
that many of these  products  currently have  limitations  which have made their
wide spread usage  unfeasible,  thereby  reducing the likelihood  that they will
replace current collimator applications in the immediate future.

     We  compete  with Hoya  Corporation  and Asahi  Corporation  in the  molded
asphere lens market.  In addition,  for lower performance  driven  applications,
Geltech competes with manufacturers of plastic aspheres.

     ISOLATORS

     We compete with a few specific  players in the isolator  segment of the WDM
components market. These include Namiki, TDK, Tokin, Kyocera, Sumitomo and Kaifa
Technology  (acquired by  E-TEK/JDS  Uniphase).  Our  strategy  does not involve
direct competition with the "catalog"  offerings of these companies;  rather, we
focus our efforts on designing and manufacturing specialty and hybrid components
according to particular  OEM  specifications  by  delivering  flexible and novel
packaging solutions achieved by our automated platform.

TRADITIONAL OPTICS

     The  market  for  optical  components  is  highly  competitive  and  highly
fragmented.  We  compete  with  manufacturers  of  conventional  spherical  lens
products  and  optical  components,  providers  of  aspheric  lenses and optical
components  and  producers of optical  quality  glass.  To a lesser  extent,  we
compete with developers of radial gradient lenses and optical  components.  Many
of these competitors have greater financial, manufacturing,  marketing and other
resources than we do.

     Manufacturers  of  conventional   lenses  and  optical  components  include
industry  giants  such as Eastman  Kodak  Corporation,  Nikon,  Olympus  Optical
Company,  Carl Zeiss and Leica AG. In addition to being substantial producers of
optical  components,  these entities are also some of the primary  customers for
such  components,   incorporating  them  into  finished  products  for  sale  to
end-users. Consequently, these competitors have significant control over certain
markets  for  our  products.  In  addition,  although  these  companies  do  not
manufacture  axial  gradient  lenses,  and  although  we  believe  that  we have
substantial technological expertise in this field, these companies could rapidly
pursue  development of axial gradient  products,  in light of their  substantial
resources.  In addition,  our products  compete  with other  products  currently
produced by these manufacturers.

     Manufacturers of aspheric lenses and optical components provide significant
competition  for our traditional  optics in providing  products that improve the
shortcomings of conventional lenses.  Aspheric lens system manufacturers include
Eastman Kodak  Corporation,  Hoya Corporation,  Schott Glass,  Hikari Glass Co.,
Ltd. and U.S.  Precision Lens. The use of aspheric surfaces provides the optical
designer with a powerful tool in correcting spherical  aberrations and enhancing
performance in state-of-the-art optical products. But the nonspheric surfaces of
glass  "aspheres"  are difficult to fabricate and test,  are limited in diameter
range and induce light  scatter.  Plastic  molded  aspheres,  on the other hand,
allow for high volume production, but primarily are limited to low-tech consumer
products that do not place a high demand on performance  (such as plastic lenses
in disposable  cameras).  Molded plastic aspheres appear in products that stress
weight, size and cost as their measure of success.

     To a lesser extent,  we compete with  manufacturers of other gradient index
lens materials. Currently, processes to produce gradient index materials include
ion-exchange,  chemical vapor deposition and Sol-Gel, all of which produce small
radial gradient index rods with limited applications.  Manufacturers using these
processes include Nippon Sheet Glass, Olympus Optical Company, and Gradient Lens
Corporation. We believe that these processes are limited by the small refractive
index  change  achievable  (typically,  < 0.05),  the  small  skin  depth of the
gradient  region  (typically  < 3 mm),  the lack of  control of the shape of the
resultant  gradient  profile,  limited  glass  compositions,  and  high per unit
manufacturing costs.

MANUFACTURING

     COLLIMATORS AND GRADIUM

     LightPath  has  full  scale  commercial  manufacturing  operations  in  its
Albuquerque,  New Mexico  facilities,  totaling  30,300 square feet  including a
5,000  square  foot clean  room that  houses our  manufacturing  stations.  Each
station  includes  laser fusion and housing  equipment and an automated  testing
process. We currently have two laser polishing stations in operation.  With this
equipment,  we believe our facilities can meet the capacity  requirements of our
planned telecom products for several years.  Due to manufacturing  techniques we
have developed,  we believe our costs to produce the standard collimator will be
less than the traditional industry manufacturing costs.

     In April 1996, we built out our lens  manufacturing  plant for  traditional
optics. We believe that the present manufacturing facility can produce in excess
of 2 million lens blanks per year depending on product size and mix. However, in
the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2002 we sold our  larger,  more  sophisticated
furnaces,  milling machines and metrology equipment to Hikari Glass Co., Ltd. of
Japan (a 40%  owned  subsidiary  of  Nikon)  ("Hikari")  as part of a  licensing
agreement  whereby  they  will  manufacture  GRADIUM  glass  for  LightPath  and
distribute to their own customers.

     Much of our  product  qualification  is  performed  in-house.  Our test and
evaluation  capabilities include Damp Heat, High/Low Temp Storage, and a Thermal
Shock Oven, which are  representative of the equipment required to meet BellCore
Testing requirements.  Our engineering  departments have full design and CAD/CAM
technical  support.  The  implementation  of  Statistical  Process  Controls has
allowed us to eliminate costly manual testing operations. We believe the ability
to maintain  consistently high quality at the  manufacturing  stage represents a
significant  and  distinctive  characteristic  of our  production  capabilities.
Quality  control  will be  critical  to our  ability to bring  telecommunication
products to market as the customers  demand rigorous testing prior to purchasing
a product.

     During the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company  announced  plans to
relocate  the  collimator  and  GRADIUM  glass  manufacturing   operations  from
Albuquerque to Orlando by September 30, 2002. We intend to move a portion of our
manufacturing  and product  qualification  equipment to this facility.  We wrote
down underutilized  assets at June 30, 2002 and these assets will be disposed of
during  fiscal 2003. We will attempt to sublet any leases which do not expire in
fiscal 2003.

     SUBCONTRACTORS; STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

     We believe  that low cost  manufacturing  will be crucial to our  long-term
success.  We presently use  subcontractors  for finishing lenses,  including the
collimator  lens,  and  intend  to  continue  to do so.  We  have  the  internal
capability to finish prototype lenses and small volume orders. We have qualified
and  licensed  numerous  finishers  to  fabricate  lenses,  several of which are
located in Asia.  Qualification of additional  offshore finishers to augment our
strategy of maximizing cost efficiencies will continue to be a top manufacturing
priority  while the assembly  and  alignment  of  collimators  will be done with
automation at our manufacturing facilities.

     We entered into a 1997 strategic  alliance with Hikari as a possible second
source for GRADIUM glass production,  as a possible source for high-volume blank
production,  to increase the presence of GRADIUM  glass in Hikari's  established
Asian markets and to develop a continuous flow manufacturing process,  currently
used by Hikari for high-end optical lenses.  In February 2000,  Hikari announced
that they intended to spend $5 million to purchase equipment  necessary to build
out a second facility for GRADIUM glass materials and other products. During the
fourth  quarter of fiscal 2002 these old  agreements  were  cancelled  and a new
licensing  arrangement  was executed,  whereby Hikari will  manufacture  GRADIUM
glass for LightPath as well as Hikari customers throughout Asia.

     We have taken steps to protect our  proprietary  methods of repeatable high
quality manufacturing by patent disclosures and internal trade secret controls.

     SUPPLIERS

     Base optical materials,  used in both  optoelectronic and traditional optic
products, are manufactured and supplied by a number of major manufacturers, such
as Hikari,  Schott Glaswerke and Hoya Corporation.  Optical fiber and collimator
housings are manufactured and supplied by a number of major manufacturers,  such
as Corning. We believe that a satisfactory  supply of production  materials will
continue  to be  available  at  reasonable  prices,  although  there  can  be no
assurance in this regard.

     ISOLATORS

     Our  isolator   manufacturing  lines  are  housed  in  approximately  5,000
square-feet  of clean room space  (certified  Class  10,000)  within the Walnut,
California  facility.  The  manufacturing  lab contains  dual beam laser welding
stations,  sub-micron  alignment engines,  robotic assembly stations,  automated
dispensing  systems and precision  dicing  equipment.  A tool and die operation,
including EDM  capability,  is located in a separate shop and assembly area. The
shop supports  product design and  automation  efforts  including  metrology and
inspection,  part  prototype  fabrication  for  proof of  concept,  and  machine
building from prototype to production line. The primary benefits of our approach
to  manufacturing  are (i)  reduced  costs  as a result  of  higher  yields  and
throughput,  and (ii)  product  consistency  as a result of  eliminating  manual
labor. We believe we are the only manufacturer of free-space isolators currently
using  automated   manufacturing.   The  Walnut  facility  has  similar  product
qualification processes and equipment as the Albuquerque facility.

     SUPPLIERS

     We currently  purchase a few key materials from single or limited  sources.
The  polarizing  glass used in our  isolator  products is supplied  primarily by
Corning and is marketed as  Polarcor(TM).  To date, we have been able to acquire
an ample  supply of  polarizing  glass.  Garnet and other  crystals  used in our
isolator products are provided by a number of vendors, including Casix, Sumitomo
and TDK.  Available  quantities  and  adequate  pricing of garnet has not proven
problematic.  We believe that a satisfactory supply of production materials will
continue  to be  available  at  competitive  prices,  although  there  can be no
assurance in this regard.

     We rely on local and  regional  vendors  for  component  materials  such as
housings,  fixtures and magnets. In addition,  certain products require external
processing such as brazing and  metalization.  To date, we have found a suitable
number of qualified vendors in the Southern California market.

     MOLDED ASPHERES

     Our  manufacturing  lines for  molded  aspheres  are housed in a new 41,000
square feet, production facility in Orlando,  Florida which we moved into in the
second quarter of fiscal 2002.  This space was designed to  accommodate  current
and future growth needs in Orlando.  The new facility  features  extensive clean
room operations, expanded tooling and coating work areas, and expanded areas for
the production of micro-lens arrays and passive integrated  assemblies.  The new
production   facility   will  also   emphasize   automation  in  all  phases  of
manufacturing. The new facility is expected to provide Geltech with the platform
to significantly reduce costs through process  improvements and automation,  and
provide the capacity  needed for the  fulfillment of high volume  opportunities.
The  facility  includes   extensive  research  and  development  labs  featuring
state-of-the-art  equipment and metrology. The manufacturing plants include lens
pressing equipment, high precision mold production equipment, advanced metrology
and inspection  equipment and coating facilities.  The Orlando plant features an
extensive tooling and machine shop, developed for the fabrication of proprietary
press workstations, and advanced mold development.

     During the fourth  quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company  announced  plans to
relocate  the  collimator  and  GRADIUM  glass  manufacturing   operations  from
Albuquerque to Orlando by September 30, 2002.

     We utilize a number of glass compositions for the manufacture of our molded
glass aspheres and lens array  products.  One such glass is a proprietary  glass
composition  licensed  from and  manufactured  by Corning  Inc.  Corning Inc. is
currently  the sole  source  for  this  glass  composition.  We  believe  that a
satisfactory  supply of  production  materials  will continue to be available at
competitive prices, although there can be no assurance in this regard. Suppliers
and second sources of other glass compositions are readily available.

     We also rely on local and  regional  vendors for  component  materials  and
services such as chemicals and inert gases,  specialty ceramics, UV coatings and
other specialty coatings.  To date, we have found a suitable number of qualified
vendors for these materials and services.

PATENTS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

     Our policy is to protect our  technology  by, among other things,  patents,
trade secret protection,  trademarks and copyrights.  As of June 2002, LightPath
and its subsidiaries  have fifty-six issued U.S. patents,  thirty-three  foreign
patents and have filed numerous  applications  for  additional  U.S. and foreign
patents.  Patents have been issued,  and/or patent applications have been filed,
in  the  areas  of  glass  composition,   glass  molding,  gradient  geometries,
production  processes,  sol-gel  processing,  product design,  fiber attachment,
robotic assembly and micro-fabrication.  The first of our issued patents expires
in 2006; the remainder expire at various times through 2019. Patent applications
corresponding to our U.S.  applications have been filed in the patent offices in
Europe and Japan  pursuant to the Patent  Cooperation  Treaty.  Under the Patent
Cooperation  Treaty, a patent applicant may file one patent application and have
it  acknowledged  as an accepted  filing in as many member nations to the Patent
Cooperation Treaty as the applicant elects.

     In addition to patent protection,  certain process inventions, lens designs
and innovations are retained as trade secrets. A key feature of GRADIUM glass is
that,  once  fabricated,  it does not reveal our formula upon inspection and, to
our knowledge, cannot be reverse-engineered.

     LightPath(R)  is now  registered as a service mark in the United States and
GRADIUM (R) is a registered  trademark.  Geltech's StableSil (R) is a registered
trademark.

     There can be no assurance  that any issued  patents owned by us will afford
adequate  protection  to us or  not be  challenged,  invalidated,  infringed  or
circumvented,  or that patent applications  relating to our products will result
in patents being issued. There can be no assurance that any rights granted to us
for  technologies  that we may  license in the future will  provide  competitive
advantages to us. There can be no assurance that patents owned or licensed by us
that  are  issued  in  one  jurisdiction  will  also  be  issued  in  any  other
jurisdiction. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the validity of any of
the patents  would be upheld if  challenged  by others in litigation or that our
activities would not infringe upon patents owned by others.

     Further,  there can be no  assurance  that  others  have not  independently
developed  or will not  independently  develop  and patent  similar or  superior
products and  technologies,  duplicate  any of our products or  technologies  or
design  around our  patents.  There can be no assurance  that patents  issued to
others will not adversely  affect the  development or  commercialization  of our
products  or  technologies.  We do not  have  an  insurance  policy  for  patent
infringement  liability  coverage  for costs or  damages  relating  to claims of
infringement.  We could  incur  substantial  costs in  defending  suits  brought
against us, or any of our licensees, or in suits in which we may assert that our
patent or patents  provide us with rights against others or in suits  contesting
the validity of a patent. Any such proceedings could be protracted. In addition,
there can be no assurance  that we would be  successful  in defending our patent
rights in any future infringement  action. If the outcome of any such litigation
is adverse to our interests, our business may be materially adversely affected.

     We do not believe that any of our  products or processes  infringe any U.S.
or foreign patent rights of any other party. There can be no assurance, however,
that our products or  processes  do not  infringe on a United  States or foreign
patent,  or patent  application.  Patent  applications  in the United States are
maintained  in secrecy  until the patent is issued.  We could incur  substantial
costs in defending ourself in infringement  litigation  brought by others, or in
prosecuting infringement claims against third parties. An adverse party claiming
patent or copyright  infringement might assert claims for substantial damages or
seek to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief,  which could effectively
block the ability for us to make, use, distribute and sell products.

     We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary  know-how. We seek to protect
our  trade  secrets  and  proprietary  know-how,  in  part,  by  confidentiality
agreements with our employees,  consultants and customers. However, there can be
no assurance that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached or that we
would  have  adequate  remedies  for any  breach.  Some  of the  confidentiality
agreements that we rely upon will expire in the next few years.  There can be no
assurance  that others will not  independently  develop  technology or processes
substantially  equivalent to or better than our technology or processes, or that
our trade  secrets  will not  otherwise  become  disclosed  to or  independently
discovered by our competitors.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION

     Currently, emissions and waste from our present manufacturing processes are
at such low  levels  that no  special  environmental  permits  or  licenses  are
required.  In the future,  we may need to obtain special permits for disposal of
increased  waste  by-products.  The glass  materials we utilize contain lead and
other  toxic  elements  in  a  stabilized  molecular  form.  However,  the  high
temperature diffusion process results in low-level emissions of such elements in
gaseous form. If production  reaches a certain level, we believe that we will be
able to efficiently recycle certain of our raw material waste,  thereby reducing
disposal  levels.  We  believe  that we are  presently  in  compliance  with all
material federal,  state and local laws and regulations governing our operations
and have obtained all material  licenses and permits necessary for the operation
of our business.

     Horizon  uses a  low-emission  spray booth for the  application  of certain
solvents and adhesives in its manufacturing process.  Horizon maintains a permit
for its spray  booth  through  its local air  quality  management  district  and
believes  it is in full  compliance  with all  applicable  regulations.  Geltech
utilizes certain  chemicals and solvents in its manufacturing  process.  Geltech
maintains all necessary  permits and believes it is in full  compliance with all
applicable regulations

     There are currently no federal,  state or local  regulations  that restrict
the  manufacturing  and  distribution of our telecom products or other products.
Certain  end-user  applications  will require that the complete  optical systems
receive government approval, such as U.S. Trade and Drug Administration approval
for use in  endoscopy.  In these  cases,  we will  generally  be  involved  on a
secondary  level and the OEM customer  will be  responsible  for the license and
approval process.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

     From August 1985 through June 1996,  we were engaged in basic  research and
development  that resulted in the discovery of GRADIUM glass and the proprietary
processes  for  fabricating   GRADIUM  glass  lenses.   This  research  included
theoretical  development of the  mathematical  formulas for accurately  defining
GRADIUM  glass,  development  and  refinement  of the  prescribable,  repeatable
fabrication  process,  and  development  of  the  software  modeling  tools  and
metrology.  We shipped our first GRADIUM glass products in May 1994. Our initial
flint  product  line is  lead-based.  The flint  GRADIUM  glass  family has been
expanded over the years, to include crown glasses,  titania silicate glasses and
polymer materials. We intend to continue fundamental materials research, process
and production  optimization  and the  development of new glass  compositions to
create  different  "families"  and  geometries of GRADIUM glass  materials to be
offered to  customers.  "Families"  of glass are  various  base glass  compounds
comprised  of  different   elements.   Variation  of  refractive  index  can  be
accomplished by using different elements in glass.

<PAGE>
             LightPath Technologies, Inc. - Form 10K, June 30, 2002


     Further  development  is necessary to produce  GRADIUM glass  materials for
high performance, white light applications (such as high performance microscopes
and other products where sensitive color  discrimination  is critical).  We will
continue to upgrade the material  design  modeling  software and optical  design
tools  to  facilitate   product  design.   Working  with  DR  Technologies,   we
successfully  completed the development of GRADIUM polymer and acrylic materials
in fiscal 1998.  These  materials  may be used for solar  concentrators  used in
space  applications  and for  conformal  optics  (optics  that conform to design
specifications  of aircraft  and  missiles)  where more  aerodynamic  shapes are
required.

     The  majority of present  development  efforts are focused on the  standard
collimator  assembly and integrated  modules.  Our acquired  businesses continue
their   efforts  in  the  area  of  isolators   and  next   generation   optical
subassemblies,   waveguides,  lens  arrays  and  sub-assembly  technologies.  We
incurred  expenditures for research and development  during the years ended June
30, 2002, 2001 and 2000 of $7,095,649, $7,089,931 and $1,449,347,  respectively.
In addition, during fiscal 2001and fiscal 2000, $9.1 million and $4.2 million of
in-process  research  and  developments  costs  were  expensed  related  to  the
acquisitions of Geltech and Horizon,  respectively.  We currently plan to expend
approximately  $3.6  million for research and  development  during  fiscal 2003,
which could vary depending upon the progress of projects  currently in the proof
of concept stage.

EMPLOYEES

     We currently have 167 full-time employees in California, New Mexico, Texas,
Florida and New Jersey. We expect to terminate approximately 67 employees in the
first quarter of fiscal 2003 as part of the  consolidation  we announced in June
2002.  Any  employee  additions  or  terminations  over the next twelve  months,
primarily  consisting of  manufacturing  personnel,  will be dependent  upon the
actual sales levels  realized  during  fiscal  2003.  Twenty-two  of our present
employees  are engaged in  management,  administrative  and clerical  functions,
twenty-one   in  research  and  product   development,   nineteen  in  equipment
automation,  eleven in sales and marketing and ninety-four are in production and
metrology.  We intend to continue  our current  practice  of  utilizing  outside
consultants,  where appropriate, in addition to hiring full-time personnel. None
of our employees are represented by labor unions.

RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS SHOULD BE READ BY YOU TOGETHER WITH THE MORE DETAILED
INFORMATION INCLUDED AT OTHER SECTIONS OF THE FORM 10-K. OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON
JUNE 30 AND  REFERENCES  TO YEARS IN THE FORM 10K REFER TO OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED
AS OF JUNE 30 OF THE REFERENCED CALENDAR YEAR.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS

WE HAVE A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND MAY CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES.

We have  incurred net losses of $50.7  million and $60.8  million for the fiscal
years  ended  June 30,  2002 and 2001,  respectively  and we had an  accumulated
deficit of $156 million as of June 30, 2002 . During our fiscal year ending June
30, 2002 we experienced  reduced  revenues due to the  unanticipated  widespread
softening of the U.S. economy and the telecommunications industry in particular.
We experienced  order  cancellations and extensions of product shipment dates by
our customers who adjusted their inventory levels in response to slower industry
growth.  These cancellations and extensions  adversely impacted our revenues and
could  result in higher  inventory  levels  than  required  to support our sales
levels. These conditions may significantly delay, and could prevent, our ability
to achieve  profitability.  We expect to continue to incur  significant  product
development,  sales and marketing and administrative expenses, and, as a result,
we will need to generate increased revenues to achieve profitability. Even if we
achieve profitability, given the competition in, and the evolving nature of, the
optical   networking  market,  we  may  not  be  able  to  sustain  or  increase
profitability  on a  quarterly  or annual  basis.  As a result,  we will need to
generate  significantly  higher  revenues while  containing  costs and operating
expenses if we are to achieve profitability.

WE FACE ORDER  CANCELLATIONS AND EXTENSIONS OF PRODUCT SHIPMENT DATES BY SOME OF
OUR CUSTOMERS.

Our sales are  generally  made  pursuant to purchase  orders that are subject to
cancellation,  modification or rescheduling without significant penalties to our
customers.  We have recently  experienced order  cancellations and extensions of
product  shipment  dates by some of our  customers.  If  these or other  current
customers stop placing orders,  or further reduce orders,  we may not be able to
replace these orders with orders from new customers. The majority of our current
customers  do not  have  any  minimum  purchase  obligations,  and they may stop
placing  orders with us at any time,  regardless  of any forecast  they may have
previously provided.  The loss of any of our key customers or further reductions
in sales to these  customers  would  reduce  our net  revenues  from the  levels
currently expected.

WE HAVE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO CONSOLIDATE FACILITIES

In June 2002 we announced  plans to  consolidate  our  collimator and other lens
production at our Orlando  facility and close our  Albuquerque  facilities.  The
widespread softening of the U.S. economy and the telecommunications  industry in
particular has required us to lower our manufacturing and  administrative  costs
and eliminate underutilized capacity. There can be no assurances that we will be
able to retain the key employees due to relocation.  We have limited  experience
with  consolidating  businesses within our organization.  Our efforts may not be
successful and may result in unanticipated  operational  problems,  expenses and
liabilities,  and our business may suffer as a result of diversion of management
attention  due to the  consolidation.  If we are  unable  to  consolidate  these
product  lines within our  organization  in a timely and effective  manner,  our
business and our operating results will be adversely affected.

WE HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN SELLING PRODUCTS TO THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY.

We  have  only   generated   revenues   from  the  sale  of   products   to  the
telecommunications  industry  since fiscal 1999.  Through June 1996, our primary
activities  were basic research and  development  of glass material  properties.
Moreover,  our ability to accurately forecast revenues is impacted by weaknesses
and  uncertainties   regarding  overall  demand  within  the  telecommunications
industry,  inventory  levels within the industry,  sudden order  reductions  and
cancellations  by  customers,  lower backlog of customer  orders,  and potential
pricing  pressures  that may arise  from  supply/demand  conditions  within  the
industry. Because we have only recently begun to sell these products, we have in

                                       20
<PAGE>
             LightPath Technologies, Inc. - Form 10K, June 30, 2002


the past and may in the future be unable to  accurately  forecast  our  revenues
from  sales  of  these  products,  and we  have  limited  meaningful  historical
financial  data  upon  which  to plan  future  operating  expenses.  Many of our
expenses are fixed in the short term,  and we may not be able to quickly  reduce
spending  if  our   revenue  is  lower  than  we  project.   Major  new  product
introductions  will also result in  increased  operating  expenses in advance of
generating revenues,  if any. Therefore,  net losses in a given quarter could be
greater than expected.  We may not be able to address the risks  associated with
our limited  operating  history in an emerging market and our business  strategy
may not be sustainable.  Failure to accurately  forecast our revenues and future
operating  expenses could cause  quarterly  fluctuations in our net revenues and
may result in volatility or a decline in our stock price.

OUR PRODUCTS  ARE AT AN EARLY STAGE OF  DEVELOPMENT  AND MAY NOT ACHIEVE  MARKET
ACCEPTANCE.

Many of our telecommunications products are still in the introductory phase, and
our current line of GRADIUM  products,  and other traditional  optics,  have not
generated  sufficient  revenues  to sustain  operations.  While we  believe  our
existing products are commercially viable, we anticipate the need to educate the
optical components market in order to generate market demand and market feedback
may require us to further  refine  these  products.  Development  of  additional
product lines will require  significant further research,  development,  testing
and marketing  prior to  commercialization.  There can be no assurance  that any
proposed products will be successfully developed,  demonstrate desirable optical
performance, be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable
costs or be successfully marketed.

OUR PRODUCTS HAVE NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL.

Our collimator products have not yet achieved broad commercial  acceptance,  our
isolator sales first entered the commercial  production phase in April 2000 with
one significant  customer and our molded aspheres telecom  applications are new.
Although  we  are  engaged  in  negotiations   and  discussions  with  potential
customers,  there can be no  assurance  that any such  discussions  will lead to
development of commercially viable products or significant  revenues, if any, or
that any  products  currently  existing  or to be  developed  in the future will
attain sufficient market acceptance to generate  significant  revenues.  We must
also satisfy industry-standard  Telcordia testing on telecommunication  products
to meet customer requirements,  as well as satisfy prospective customers that we
will be able to meet their demand for  quantities  of products,  since we may be
the sole supplier and licensor.  We do not have experience as a manufacturer for
all our product lines and have limited financial resources.  We may be unable to
accomplish  any one or more of the foregoing to the extent  necessary to develop
market acceptance of our products.

Although our traditional  optics products have been accepted  commercially,  the
benefits of the GRADIUM  glass line are not widely  known.  In order to persuade
potential  customers  to  purchase  GRADIUM  products,  we will need to overcome
industry  resistance  to, and suspicion of,  gradient lens  technology  that has
resulted from previous failed attempts by various  researchers and manufacturers
unrelated to us to develop a repeatable, consistent process for producing lenses
with  variable  refractive  indices.  Prospective  customers  will  need to make
substantial  expenditures in order to redesign  products to incorporate  GRADIUM
lenses.  There  can be no  assurances  that  potential  customers  will view the
benefits of our products as sufficient to warrant such design expenditures.

WE DEPEND ON A FEW KEY CUSTOMERS.

In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002,  Finisar Corp.  accounted for 24% of our
net revenue. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001 Agere Systems, Inc., Corning
Inc. and JDS Uniphase  accounted  for 44%,  7.4%,  and 5.2% of our net revenues,
respectively.  We anticipate that our operating  results will continue to depend
on sales to a relatively small number of significant customers.  The loss of any
of these customers,  or a significant  reduction in sales to any such customers,
could adversely affect our revenues.

RISKS RELATED TO THE OPTICAL NETWORKING INDUSTRY

SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS  DEPENDS UPON  DEPLOYMENT  OF OPTICAL  NETWORKS TO SATISFY
INCREASED BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS.

Our future  success  depends on the  continuing  increase  in the amount of data
transmitted  over  communications  networks,  or  bandwidth,  and the  growth of
optical  networks to meet the increased  demand for  bandwidth.  If the Internet
does not continue to expand as a widespread communications medium and commercial
marketplace,  the need for significantly increased bandwidth across networks and
the market for optical networking  products may not continue to develop.  Future
demand for our  products is  uncertain  and will depend to a great degree on the
continued growth and upgrading of optical networks.  If the growth and upgrading
of optical networks does not continue,  sales of our products may decline, which
would adversely affect our revenues.

THE OPTICAL  NETWORKING  MARKET IS NEW AND  UNPREDICTABLE  AND  CHARACTERIZED BY
RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND EVOLVING STANDARDS.

The optical  networking  market is relatively new and is  characterized by rapid
technological change,  frequent new product  introductions,  changes in customer
requirements and evolving industry standards.  Because this market is relatively
new,  it is  difficult  to predict its  potential  size or future  growth  rate.
Widespread  adoption of optical  networks  is  critical  to our future  success.
Potential  end-user customers who have invested  substantial  resources in their
existing  copper lines or other  systems may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new
approach,  like optical  networks.  Our success in  generating  revenues in this
emerging market will depend on, among other things:

     -    maintaining and enhancing our relationships with our customers;
     -    the  education of potential  end-user  customers  and network  service
          providers about the benefits of optical networks; and
     -    our ability to  accurately  predict  and develop our  products to meet
          industry standards.

If we fail to address changing market conditions,  the sales of our products may
decline, which would adversely impact our revenues.

WE MUST INCREASE OUR SALES VOLUMES,  REDUCE OUR COSTS OR INTRODUCE HIGHER MARGIN
PRODUCTS TO OFFSET  ANTICIPATED  REDUCTIONS IN THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF OUR
PRODUCTS.

We have  experienced  decreases  in the  average  selling  prices of some of our
products,  including most of our passive component products.  We anticipate that
as products in the optical component and module market become more commoditized,
the  average  selling  prices  of our  products  may  decrease  in  response  to
competitive pricing pressures,  new product introductions by us, our competitors
or other  factors.  The  optical  component  and module  market is  experiencing
extreme  volatility  as a result of lower  product  demand,  which  will make it
difficult  for us to increase our sales  volume.  If we are unable to offset the
anticipated  decrease  in our average  selling  prices by  increasing  our sales
volumes or product  mix, our net revenues  and gross  margins will  decline.  In
addition,  to maintain or improve our gross margins,  we must continue to reduce
the  manufacturing  cost of our products,  and we must develop and introduce new
products and product  enhancements with higher margins. If we cannot maintain or
improve our gross  margins,  our financial  position may be harmed and our stock
price may decline.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS

OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND SUCCESSFULLY  INTRODUCE
NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS.

Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate our customers' needs and
develop  products  that address  those needs.  Introduction  of new products and
product  enhancements  will  require  that we  effectively  transfer  production
processes  from research and  development  to  manufacturing  and coordinate our
efforts with the efforts of our suppliers to rapidly  achieve  efficient  volume
production.  If we fail to effectively  transfer production  processes,  develop
product  enhancements  or  introduce  new  products  that  meet the needs of our
customers as scheduled, our net revenues may decline.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED COMPANIES,  OUR BUSINESS MAY
BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

During the calendar  year ended  December 31, 2000, we acquired both Horizon and
Geltech in separate transactions.  The efficient integration of these businesses
into our  organization  will be  important to our  success.  If our  integration
efforts prove to be unsuccessful,  our business will suffer.  We have spent, and
expect  to  continue  to  spend,  significant  financial,  management  and other
resources to integrate  these  businesses into our  organization.  Our headcount
increased substantially as a result of the acquisitions, and these new employees
must be integrated  with our existing  employees.  Both Horizon and Geltech were
privately  held and may  require  substantial  investments  in  operational  and
financial  infrastructure to ensure that their systems and processes  adequately
support operating as a publicly held organization.  Each of these  organizations
will also need additional  investments in manufacturing  infrastructure in order
to  develop  new  products  and  ramp up  production  volumes.  There  can be no
assurances  that we will be able to retain  the key  employees  of  Horizon  and
Geltech.  We have limited experience with integrating  acquired  businesses into
our organization.  Our integration  efforts may not be successful and may result
in unanticipated operations problems, expenses and liabilities and the diversion
of management attention.  If we are unable to integrate these companies into our
organization  in a timely and effective  manner,  our business and our operating
results will be adversely affected.

We  anticipate  that in the future,  as part of our  business  strategy,  we may
continue to make strategic acquisitions of complementary companies,  products or
technologies. In the event of any further future acquisitions, we could:

     -    issue  stock that would  dilute our current  stockholders'  percentage
          ownership;
     -    incur debt;
     -    assume liabilities; or
     -    incur expenses  related to in-process  research and  development,  and
          amortization of intangible assets.

Any future acquisitions also could involve numerous risks, including:

     -    problems   associated   with   combining   the  acquired   operations,
          technologies or products;
     -    unanticipated costs or liabilities;
     -    diversion of management's attention from our core business;
     -    adverse effects on existing business  relationships with suppliers and
          customers;
     -    risks  associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited
          prior experience; and
     -    potential  loss of key employees,  particularly  those of the acquired
          businesses.

We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully  integrate any businesses,
products,  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future,  which
may harm our business.

COMPETITION  MAY INCREASE,  WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR SALES AND GROSS  MARGINS,  OR
CAUSE US TO LOSE MARKET SHARE.

Competition  in the optical  component  and module market in which we compete is
intense.  Many of our  competitors  are large public  companies that have longer
operating histories and significantly  greater financial,  technical,  marketing
and other  resources than we have. As a result,  these  competitors  are able to
devote greater  resources than we can to the  development,  promotion,  sale and
support of their  products.  In  addition,  the market  capitalization  and cash
reserves of several of our  competitors  are much  larger  than ours,  and, as a
result,  these  competitors  are much better  positioned  than we are to acquire
other companies in order to gain new  technologies or products that may displace
our product  lines.  Such  acquisitions  could give our  competitors a strategic
advantage.  For  example,  if our  competitors  acquire  any of our  significant
customers,  these customers may reduce the amount of products they purchase from
us.  Alternatively,  some of our  competitors  may spin-out new companies in the
optical   component  and  module  market.   These  companies  may  compete  more
aggressively than their former parent companies due to their greater  dependence
on  our  markets.   In  addition,   many  of  our  potential   competitors  have
significantly  more established sales and customer support  organizations,  much
greater  name  recognition,   more  extensive  customer  bases,  more  developed

                                       23
<PAGE>
             LightPath Technologies, Inc. - Form 10K, June 30, 2002


distribution  channels  and  broader  product  offerings  than  we  have.  These
companies can leverage their customer  bases and broader  product  offerings and
adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share.  Additional  competitors
may enter the market,  and we are likely to compete  with new  companies  in the
future.  We  expect to  encounter  potential  customers  that,  due to  existing
relationships  with our  competitors,  are committed to the products  offered by
these  competitors.  As a  result  of the  foregoing  factors,  we  expect  that
competitive  pressures may result in price reductions,  reduced margins and loss
of market share.

We compete  with  manufacturers  of  conventional  spherical  lens  products and
aspherical  lens  products,   producers  of  optical  quality  glass  and  other
developers of gradient lens technology as well as telecom product manufacturers.
In both the  optical  lens and  telecommunications  components  markets,  we are
competing against, among others, established international industry giants. Many
of these companies also are primary customers for optical and  telecommunication
components,  and therefore have significant control over certain markets for our
products.  We are also aware of other  companies  that are attempting to develop
radial  gradient lens  technology.  There may also be others of which we are not
aware that are attempting to develop axial gradient lens  technology  similar to
our technology.  There can be no assurance that existing or new competitors will
not develop  technologies that are superior to or more  commercially  acceptable
than our existing and planned technologies and products.

OUR PRODUCTS MAY CONTAIN UNKNOWN DEFECTS.

Some of our products  are  designed to be deployed in large and complex  optical
networks. Because of the nature of these products, they can only be fully tested
for  reliability  when deployed in networks for long periods of time.  Our fiber
optic products may contain  undetected  defects when first  introduced or as new
versions are released,  and our  customers may discover  defects in our products
only  after  they have been  fully  deployed  and  operated  under  peak  stress
conditions.  In addition,  our products  often are combined  with  products from
other  vendors.  As a result,  should  problems  occur,  it may be  difficult to
identify  the source of the  problem.  If we are unable to fix  defects or other
problems, we could experience, among other things:

     -    loss of customers;
     -    damage to our brand reputation;
     -    failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance;
     -    diversion of development and engineering resources; and
     -    legal actions by our customers or third parties.

The  occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing  factors could cause our net
revenues to decline or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.

WE FACE PRODUCT LIABILITY RISKS.

The sale of our  optical  products  will  involve the  inherent  risk of product
liability  claims by others.  We do not  currently  maintain  product  liability
insurance coverage. Product liability insurance is expensive, subject to various
coverage  exclusions  and may not be obtainable on terms  acceptable to us if we
decide to procure such insurance in the future.  Moreover,  the amount and scope
of any  coverage  may be  inadequate  to  protect us in the event that a product
liability claim is successfully asserted.

OUR PRODUCTS HAVE LONG AND VARIABLE SALES CYCLES.

The timing of our  revenue  is  difficult  to predict  because of the length and
variability of the sales and implementation  cycles for our products.  We do not
recognize  revenue  until  a  product  has  been  shipped  to  a  customer,  all
significant  vendor obligations have been performed and collection is considered
probable. Customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and
strategic decision.  As a result,  customers typically expend significant effort
in  evaluating,  testing  and  qualifying  our  products  and our  manufacturing
process.  This customer evaluation and qualification  process frequently results
in a lengthy initial sales cycle (often one year or longer). While our customers
are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us, we may incur
substantial  sales and  marketing  and  research  and  development  expenses  to
customize our products to the customer's  needs. We may also expend  significant
management  efforts,  increase  manufacturing  capacity and order long lead-time
components or materials prior to receiving an order.  Even after this evaluation

                                       24
<PAGE>
             LightPath Technologies, Inc. - Form 10K, June 30, 2002


process,  a potential  customer may not purchase  our  products.  Because of the
evolving  nature of the optical  component and module market,  we cannot predict
the length of these sales and  development  cycles.  The recent  slowdown in the
U.S.  economy has  resulted in order  cancellations  and  extensions  of product
shipment  dates by our  customers.  These long sales  cycles,  coupled  with the
uncertain  affects of the slowdown in the U.S.  economy,  may cause our revenues
and operating  results to vary  significantly  and unexpectedly  from quarter to
quarter, which could continue to cause volatility in our stock price.

WE DEPEND ON KEY PERSONNEL TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS EFFECTIVELY.

Our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers
and  other  key  engineering,   sales,  marketing,   manufacturing  and  support
personnel.  Our  inability  to retain or  attract  key  employees  could  have a
material  adverse  effect  on  our  business  and  results  of  operations.  Our
operations  depend, to a great extent,  upon the efforts of our senior officers.
We also depend upon our ability to attract  additional members to our management
and operations teams to support our expansion strategy. The loss of any of these
key employees  would adversely  affect our business.  We had  approximately  167
full-time  employees on June 30, 2002. Although we have reduced our workforce by
approximately  133 people  during the last fiscal year, we expect to continue to
hire  selectively  in the  manufacturing,  engineering,  sales and marketing and
administrative  functions to the extent consistent with our business levels. Our
ability to continue to attract and retain  highly  skilled  personnel  will be a
critical  factor in determining  whether we will be successful.  Competition for
highly  skilled  personnel is intense.  We may not be successful in  attracting,
assimilating or retaining  qualified  personnel to fulfill our current or future
needs,  which  could  adversely  impact  our  ability  to  develop  and sell our
products.

WE HAVE LIMITED PRODUCT  OFFERINGS,  SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY  EXPERIENCING A
DECLINE IN DEMAND.

We derive a  substantial  portion of our net revenues  from a limited  number of
products.  Specifically,  in the fiscal  year ended  June 30,  2002,  we derived
approximately  35%,  14.5%,  17.2%  and  33.3%  of our  net  revenues  from  our
isolators,  collimators, molded aspheric lenses and traditional optics products,
respectively. We expect that net revenues from a limited number of products will
continue to account for a substantial portion of our total net revenues.  Demand
for these and other  optical  component  and module  products  has declined as a
result of the recent slowdown in the U.S.  economy and we continue to experience
order cancellations and delays in product shipment dates by our customers. Aside
from the current  slowdown in the  telecommunications  industry,  continued  and
widespread  market acceptance of our products is critical to our future success.
We  cannot  assure  you that,  once the  telecommunication  industry  conditions
improve,  our current  products  will achieve  market  acceptance at the rate at
which we  expect,  or at all,  which  could  adversely  affect  our  results  of
operations.

WE MUST  ACCURATELY  TIME OUR  MANUFACTURING  CAPACITY  WITH THE  DEMAND FOR OUR
PRODUCTS.

We face a challenge in accurately  timing the installation of our  manufacturing
capacity  with the demand for our products.  Throughout  fiscal 2001 we expanded
our manufacturing capacity through the expansion of facilities and the hiring of
employees  and through the  acquisition  of Geltech.  At June 30, 2002, we had a
total of 167 full-time employees, down from 300 employees at June 30, 2001. As a
result of the recent, and sudden,  order cancellations and extensions of product
shipment dates by our  customers,  we are slowing the rate of production of some
of our  products.  We have  announced  that we intend to terminate 67 additional
employees by December 2002 as we consolidate our facilities. We also may curtail
efforts to install new  equipment  in our  facilities  until  market  conditions
improve. We believe this approach will allow us to quickly ramp up production if
unit  demand  for our  products  merits.  However,  if demand  for our  products
continues  to  decline,  we may have more  employees  and  facility  space  than
necessary to deliver our products,  which would adversely  impact our ability to
achieve  profitability,  and could require us to further  reduce the size of our
operations.

Despite our recent  announcement of plans to consolidate our business,  we still
face  challenges  as a result of our rapid  expansion  over the past few  fiscal
years.  The increase in employees as a result of our acquisitions and the growth
in   our    operations,    combined    with   the    challenges    of   managing
geographically-dispersed  operations, have placed, and will continue to place, a
significant  strain on our management  systems and resources.  We expect that we

                                       25
<PAGE>
             LightPath Technologies, Inc. - Form 10K, June 30, 2002


will  need to  continue  to  improve  our  financial  and  managerial  controls,
reporting  systems and procedures  and continue to expand,  train and manage our
work  force.  The  failure  to  effectively  manage  our  recent  growth  and to
accurately  time any future  growth with market  demand for our  products  could
adversely  impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products,  which could
reduce our revenues.

WE MUST EXPAND OUR SALES ORGANIZATION.

The sale of our products  requires long and involved efforts targeted at several
key departments within our prospective  customers'  organizations.  Sales of our
products  require the prolonged  efforts of executive  personnel and specialized
systems and  applications  engineers  working  together  with a small  number of
dedicated  salespersons.  Currently,  our sales organization is limited. We will
need to grow our sales force in order to increase market  awareness and sales of
our products.  Competition for these individuals is intense, and we might not be
able to hire the kind and number of sales personnel and  applications  engineers
we need. If we are unable to expand our sales operations,  we may not be able to
increase market awareness or sales of our products,  which would prevent us from
increasing our revenues.

WE MUST MAKE SALES IN A FRAGMENTED MARKET.

The markets  for  optical  lenses and  telecommunication  components  are highly
fragmented.  Consequently,  we will need to  identify  and  successfully  target
particular  market  segments in which we believe we will have the most  success.
These  efforts will  require a  substantial,  but unknown,  amount of effort and
resources.  The fragmented  nature of the optical products market may impede our
ability to achieve  commercial  acceptance  for our products.  In addition,  our
success  will  depend in great part on our  ability to develop  and  implement a
successful  marketing  and sales  program.  There can be no  assurance  that any
marketing and sales  efforts  undertaken by us will be successful or will result
in any significant product sales.

CURRENT AND PENDING LITIGATION MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OPERATING RESULTS.

On May 2, 2000,  the Company  commenced a class  action  lawsuit in the Chancery
Court of Delaware,  New Castle County (the "Court"). In this action, the Company
sought a declaratory  judgment with respect to the Company's right to redeem the
Class E Common  Stock on March 31,  2001 for $.0001 per share,  the right of the
holders  of Class E Common  Stock to vote at the  Annual  Meeting  to be held on
October 6, 2000, and for certification of the holders of Class E Common Stock as
a class and the named  defendants as its  representatives.  The final Settlement
Agreement of this  lawsuit  requires the Company to pay $0.40 per Class E share.
The  Settlement   Agreement  permits  Class  E  shareholders  to  elect  not  to
participate  in the  settlement  and thus  will not be  binding  on any  Class E
shareholders who so elect.  Approximately 12% of the former Class E shareholders
elected not to participate in the  settlement.  Based on the above,  the Company
estimates the total cost of the Settlement Agreement at $1.5 million, which will
be distributed during the first quarter of fiscal 2003.

On or about June 9,  2000,  a small  group of  holders  of Class E Common  Stock
commenced an action in a state court in Texas (the "Texas  Action").  Plaintiffs
in the Texas Action have made various  allegations  regarding the  circumstances
surrounding the issuance of the Class E Common Stock and seek damages based upon
those  allegations.  Management  believes the  allegations  underlying the Texas
litigation are without merit,  however,  we are unable to predict the outcome of
this litigation at this time.

The Company may from time to time become  involved in other  lawsuits  and legal
proceedings.  Litigation  is subject to inherent  uncertainties,  and an adverse
result in any such matters that may arise from time to time may adversely impact
our operating results or financial  condition.  Additionally,  any litigation to
which  we are  subject  could  require  significant  involvement  of our  senior
management  and  may  divert  management's   attention  from  our  business  and
operations.

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL SALES.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002,  approximately  14% of our net revenues
were from sales to  international  customers.  Our  international  sales will be
limited if we cannot establish and/or maintain  relationships with international
distributors,  establish foreign  operations,  expand  international  sales, and

                                       26
<PAGE>
             LightPath Technologies, Inc. - Form 10K, June 30, 2002


develop  relationships with international service providers.  Additionally,  our
international sales may be adversely affected if international economies weaken.
We are subject to risks including the following:

     -    greater  difficulty  in  accounts  receivable  collection  and  longer
          collection periods;
     -    the impact of recessions in economies outside the United States;
     -    unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;
     -    sudden and unexpected  reductions in demand in particular countries in
          response to exchange rate fluctuations;
     -    certification requirements;
     -    reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
     -    potentially adverse tax consequences; and
     -    political and economic instability.

While we expect our  international  revenues to be denominated  predominantly in
U.S. dollars, in the future a portion of our international revenues and expenses
may be denominated in foreign currencies.  Accordingly,  we could experience the
risks of fluctuating currencies and the corresponding exchange rates.

OUR STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE.

Broad market fluctuations or fluctuations in our operations may adversely affect
the market  price of our  Common  Stock.  The  market  for our  Common  Stock is
volatile. The trading price of our Common Stock has been and will continue to be
subject to:

     -    volatility  in the trading  markets  generally  and in our  particular
          market segment;
     -    limited trading of our common stock;
     -    significant  fluctuations  in  response  to  quarterly  variations  in
          operating results;
     -    announcements  regarding our business or the business of our customers
          or competitors;
     -    changes in prices of our or our competitors' products and services;
     -    changes in product mix;
     -    changes in revenue and revenue growth rates; and
     -    other events or factors.

Statements  or  changes  in  opinions,  ratings or  earnings  estimates  made by
brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the markets in which we operate
or expect to operate  could have an  adverse  effect on the market  price of our
Common  Stock.  In  addition,  the  stock  market  as a  whole,  as  well as our
particular market segment,  have from time to time experienced extreme price and
volume  fluctuations  which have particularly  affected the market price for the
securities  of many  companies  and  which  often  have  been  unrelated  to the
operating performance of these companies.

DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE IS UNLIKELY.

Our  Board  has  never  declared  a  dividend  on our  Common  Stock.  We do not
anticipate paying dividends on the Common Stock in the foreseeable future. It is
anticipated  that  earnings,  if any, will be reinvested in the expansion of our
business.

POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF EXISTING MANAGEMENT AND PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS.

If our  management  and  shareholders  act in  concert,  disposition  of matters
submitted to  shareholders  or the election of the entire Board of Directors may
be  hindered.  We  estimate  that  management  and  our  principal  shareholders
beneficially  owned  approximately XX% of the aggregate Common Stock outstanding
as of August 1, 2002.

SOME  PROVISIONS  IN OUR  CHARTER  DOCUMENTS  AND BYLAWS MAY HAVE  ANTI-TAKEOVER
EFFECTS.

Our Certificate of  Incorporation  and Bylaws contain some provisions that could
have the effect of  discouraging  a  prospective  acquirer  from making a tender
offer for our commons stock,  or which may otherwise  delay,  defer or prevent a
change in control.

OUR WARRANTS AND OPTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCING.

The existence of our  outstanding  options or warrants may adversely  affect the
terms on which we can obtain  additional  financing.  As of June 30,  2002 there
were outstanding:

     -    warrants issued in private placement and other  transactions  pursuant
          to which 299,300 shares of Common Stock are issuable; and
     -    outstanding  options to purchase an aggregate  of 4,518,412  shares of
          Common Stock.

In addition,  approximately  386,000  shares of Common Stock were reserved as of
June 30,  2002 for  issuance  pursuant  to future  grants  to be made  under the
Omnibus Incentive Plan and Directors Stock Incentive Plan.

For the life of such options and warrants, the holders will have the opportunity
to  profit  from a rise in the  price of the  underlying  common  stock,  with a
resulting  dilution  in the  interest  of other  holders  of common  stock  upon
exercise or conversion.  Further, the option and warrant holders can be expected
to  exercise  their  options  and  warrants  at a time  when  we  would,  in all
likelihood,  be able to obtain additional capital by an offering of our unissued
common stock on terms more  favorable to us than those  provided by such options
or warrants.

The  eligibility  of the  foregoing  shares  to be sold to the  public,  whether
pursuant to an effective registration  statement,  Rule 144 or an exemption from
the  registration  requirements may have a material adverse effect on the market
value and trading price of the Common Stock.

WE HAVE AGREED TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS UPON POTENTIAL LIABILITY OF OUR DIRECTORS.

Our Certificate of Incorporation  provides that directors will not be personally
liable for monetary  damages to LightPath  or its  shareholders  for a breach of
fiduciary  duty as a  director,  subject to limited  exceptions.  Although  such
limitation of liability does not affect the  availability of equitable  remedies
such as injunctive relief or rescission, the presence of these provisions in the
Certificate of  Incorporation  could prevent the recovery of monetary damages by
LightPath or its shareholders.

WE MUST MAINTAIN  COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN  CRITERIA IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN LISTING
OF OUR SHARES ON THE NASDAQ MARKET.

The Company's  Common Stock is currently  traded on the Nasdaq National  Market.
Failure  to meet the  applicable  quantitative  and/or  qualitative  maintenance
requirements  of Nasdaq could result in our  securities  being delisted from the
Nasdaq National Market. Our Common stock has recently traded below the $1.00 per
share  minimum  price  requirement,  which  would  subject  our Common  Stock to
delisting.  If delisted from the Nasdaq National  Market,  our securities may be
eligible for trading on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market, the OTC Bulletin Board or on
other  over-the-counter  markets,  although  there can be no assurance  that our
securities will be eligible for trading on any alternative exchanges or markets.
As a consequence of such delisting,  an investor could find it more difficult to
dispose  of or to  obtain  accurate  quotations  as to the  market  value of our
securities. Among other consequences,  delisting from Nasdaq may cause a decline
in the stock price and difficulty in obtaining future financing.

RISK THAT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY NOT COME TRUE.

This  report  contains   forward-looking   statements  that  involve  risks  and
uncertainties. We use words such as "believe", "expect," "anticipate," "plan" or
similar words to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements
are made  based upon our  belief as of the date that such  statements  are made.
These  forward-looking  statements are based largely on our current expectations
and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond
our  control.  You  should not place  undue  reliance  on these  forward-looking
statements,  which speak as of the date of this report. Our actual results could
differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for
many reasons,  including the risks faced by us described  above and elsewhere in
this report.

BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

Our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire,  earthquake,  power loss,
telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control. We do not have a
detailed  disaster  recovery  plan.  We carry only a limited  amount of business

                                       28

interruption insurance, which may not sufficiently compensate us for losses that
may  occur.  Our  facilities  may  be  subject  to  electrical  blackouts  as  a
consequence  of a shortage of available  electrical  power.  We currently do not
have backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout.
If blackouts  interrupt  our power  supply,  we would be  temporarily  unable to
continue operations at our affected  facilities.  Any losses or damages incurred
by us as a result of blackouts or other business  interruptions could impair our
reputation,  harm our  ability to retain  existing  customers  and to obtain new
customers,  and could result in lost revenue,  any of which could  substantially
harm our business and results of operations.

WE MAY NEED  ADDITIONAL  FUTURE  FINANCING IN ORDER TO FUND OUR  OPERATIONS  AND
PLANS FOR GROWTH.

While the Company continues to take actions to reduce cash used from operations,
there can be no assurance that the Company will generate  sufficient revenues to
fund  its  future  operations  and  growth  strategies.  We may  need to  obtain
additional  financing in the future.  We do not have any commitments from others
to provide additional financing in the future and there can be no assurance that
any such additional financing will be available if needed or, if available, will
be on terms favorable to us. In the event such needed financing is not obtained,
our operations will be materially  adversely  affected and we could be forced to
cease or substantially reduce operations. Any additional equity financing may be
dilutive  to  shareholders,  and debt  financings,  if  available,  may  involve
restrictive covenants.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON THE EFFORTS OF THIRD PARTIES.

Our strategy for the  research,  development  and  commercialization  of certain
products entails  entering into various  arrangements  with corporate  partners,
OEMs,  licensees and others in order to generate  product  sales,  license fees,
royalties and other funds adequate for product development.  We may also rely on
our collaborative  partners to conduct research efforts,  product testing and to
manufacture and market certain of our products. Although we believe that parties
to any such  arrangements  would  have an  economic  motivation  to  succeed  in
performing  their  contractual  responsibilities,   the  amount  and  timing  of
resources to be devoted to these activities may not be within our control. There
can also be no assurance  that we will be  successful in  establishing  any such
collaborative  arrangements  or  that,  if  established,  the  parties  to  such
arrangements will assist us in commercializing products. We have a non-exclusive
agreement with a catalog company to distribute certain of our products.  We have
formalized  relationships with eight foreign  distributors to create markets for
GRADIUM in their  respective  countries.  There can be no  assurance  that these
parties,  or any future partners,  will perform their obligations as expected or
that any revenue will be derived from such arrangements.

RISKS RELATED TO MANUFACTURING OUR PRODUCTS

IF WE DO NOT  ACCURATELY  PROJECT  DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS,  WE WILL HAVE EXCESS
MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OR INSUFFICIENT MANUFACTURING CAPACITY.

We currently  manufacture  substantially  all of our products in our  facilities
located in Albuquerque,  New Mexico,  Walnut,  California and Orlando,  Florida.
Based on the sudden change in U.S. economic conditions, we realized lower demand
for our  products in fiscal 2002 and we now expect  only modest  improvement  in
fiscal 2003. We intend to operate at lower production  output during fiscal 2003
while  retaining  flexibility  to meet demand if it should  increase in the near
future.  Although  we  eliminated  significant  amounts of excess  manufacturing
capacity in fiscal 2002, we expect that the production  slowdown may continue to
negatively impact our gross margins during fiscal 2003. If we fail to accurately
coordinate  our  production  capacity and output with demand for our products in
the future,  we may have excess  capacity or  insufficient  capacity,  either of
which may seriously harm our results of operations.

Furthermore,  we may experience delays,  disruptions or quality control problems
in our  manufacturing  operations,  and, as a result,  product  shipments to our
customers could be delayed beyond the revised  shipment  schedules  requested by
our customers, which would negatively impact our revenues,  competitive position
and reputation.  For example, we have, in the past,  experienced a disruption in
the  manufacture  of some of our  products  due to changes in our  manufacturing
processes,  which  resulted  in reduced  manufacturing  yields and delays in the
shipment of our products. If we experience similar disruptions in the future, it

                                       29
<PAGE>
             LightPath Technologies, Inc. - Form 10K, June 30, 2002


may  result in lower  yields or delays of our  product  shipments,  which  could
adversely affect our revenues, gross margins and results of operations.

OUR FAILURE TO ACCURATELY FORECAST MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR
ADDITIONAL  COSTS,  HAVE EXCESS  INVENTORIES OR HAVE  INSUFFICIENT  MATERIALS TO
BUILD OUR PRODUCTS.

We use rolling  forecasts  based on anticipated  product orders to determine our
materials requirements. It is very important that we accurately predict both the
demand for our  products  and the lead times  required  to obtain the  necessary
materials.  Lead times for materials that we order vary significantly and depend
on  factors  such as  specific  supplier  requirements,  the size of the  order,
contract  terms and current  market demand for the materials at a given time. If
we overestimate our material requirements,  we may have excess inventory,  which
would increase our costs. If we underestimate our material requirements,  we may
have inadequate  inventory,  which could interrupt our  manufacturing  and delay
delivery  of our  products  to our  customers.  Any of these  occurrences  would
negatively  impact our results of  operations.  Recent order  cancellations  and
extension  of product  delivery  dates by our  customers  have created a risk of
material  obsolescence.   Additionally,   in  order  to  avoid  excess  material
inventories we may incur cancellation charges associated with modifying existing
purchase orders with our vendors.

IF WE DO NOT  ACHIEVE  ACCEPTABLE  MANUFACTURING  YIELDS OR  SUFFICIENT  PRODUCT
RELIABILITY, OUR ABILITY TO SHIP PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS COULD BE DELAYED.

The  manufacture of our products  involves  complex and precise  processes.  Our
manufacturing  costs for several  products  are  relatively  fixed,  and,  thus,
manufacturing  yields are critical to our results of operations.  Changes in our
manufacturing  processes  or those  of our  suppliers,  or the use of  defective
materials,  could  significantly  reduce our  manufacturing  yields and  product
reliability.  In addition,  we may experience  manufacturing  delays and reduced
manufacturing  yields upon introducing new products to our manufacturing  lines.
We may experience  lower than targeted  product yields in the future which could
adversely affect our operating results.

IF OUR CUSTOMERS DO NOT QUALIFY OUR  MANUFACTURING  LINES FOR VOLUME  SHIPMENTS,
OUR OPERATING RESULTS COULD SUFFER.

Generally, customers do not purchase our products, other than limited numbers of
evaluation units,  prior to qualification of the  manufacturing  line for volume
production.  Our existing manufacturing lines, as well as each new manufacturing
line,  must pass through  varying  levels of  qualification  with our customers.
Customers  may  require  that  we  be  registered  under  international  quality
standards,  such as ISO 9001.  This customer  qualification  process  determines
whether our  manufacturing  lines meet the customers'  quality,  performance and
reliability standards. If there are delays in qualification of our products, our
customers  may drop the product  from a long-term  supply  program,  which would
result in significant lost revenue opportunity over the term of that program.

WE DEPEND ON SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCE SUPPLIERS FOR SOME OF THE KEY MATERIALS IN
OUR  PRODUCTS,   WHICH  MAKES  US  SUSCEPTIBLE  TO  SUPPLY  SHORTAGES  OR  PRICE
FLUCTUATIONS.

We currently  purchase  several key  materials  used in the  manufacture  of our
products from single or limited source suppliers. We may fail to obtain required
materials in a timely manner in the future,  or could experience  further delays
from  evaluating  and  testing  the  products  of  these  potential  alternative
suppliers.  The recent  softening of demand in the  telecommunications  industry
could adversely  impact the financial  condition of our suppliers,  many of whom
have limited financial resources. We have in the past, and may in the future, be
required  to provide  advance  payments  in order to secure key  materials  from
financially  limited  suppliers.  Financial or other difficulties faced by these
suppliers  could  limit  the   availability  of  key  components  or  materials.
Additionally,  financial  difficulties  could  impair  our  ability  to  recover
advances made to these suppliers. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any
of these  materials,  or the inability to obtain these  materials from alternate
sources  at  acceptable  prices and within a  reasonable  amount of time,  would
impair our ability to meet  scheduled  product  deliveries  to our customers and
could cause customers to cancel orders.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY.

We rely on a combination of patent,  copyright,  trademark and trade secret laws
and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual  property rights.  We
cannot assure that our patent  applications  will be approved,  that any patents
that we may issue will protect our  intellectual  property or that third parties
will not challenge any issued patents.  Other parties may independently  develop
similar or competing  technology or design around any patents that may be issued
to us.

WE MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISPUTES AND LITIGATION.

We anticipate,  based on the size and  sophistication of our competitors and the
history  of  rapid  technological   advances  in  our  industry,   that  several
competitors may have patent  applications in progress in the United States or in
foreign countries that, if issued,  could relate to products similar to ours. If
such  patents  were to be issued,  the patent  holders or  licensees  may assert
infringement claims against us or claim that we have violated other intellectual
property rights. These claims and any resulting lawsuits,  if successful,  could
subject us to significant  liability for damages and invalidate our  proprietary
rights.  The lawsuits,  regardless of their merits,  could be time-consuming and
expensive  to  resolve  and would  divert  management  time and  attention.  Any
potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more
of the following, any of which could harm our business:

     -    stop  selling,  incorporating  or  using  our  products  that  use the
          disputed intellectual property;
     -    obtain  from  third  parties  a  license  to sell or use the  disputed
          technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or
          at all; or
     -    redesign our products that use the disputed intellectual property.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT AND ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WE MAY
BE UNABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

We regard  substantial  elements of our technology as proprietary and attempt to
protect them by relying on patent, trademark,  service mark, copyright and trade
secret  laws.  We  also  rely  on  confidentiality  procedures  and  contractual
provisions with our employees,  consultants and corporate partners. The steps we
take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate,  time consuming and
expensive.  Furthermore,  despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third
parties from  infringing upon or  misappropriating  our  intellectual  property,
which could harm our business.

It may be necessary to litigate to enforce our  patents,  copyrights,  and other
intellectual  property  rights,  to protect our trade secrets,  to determine the
validity of and scope of the  proprietary  rights of others or to defend against
claims of  infringement  or invalidity.  Such  litigation can be time consuming,
distracting  to management,  expensive and difficult to predict.  Our failure to
protect or enforce our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, prospects and results of operation.

NECESSARY  LICENSES OF THIRD-PARTY  TECHNOLOGY MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US OR MAY
BE VERY EXPENSIVE.

From time to time we may be required to license technology from third parties to
develop new products or product  enhancements.  We can provide no assurance that
third-party  licenses will be available to us on commercially  reasonable terms,
or at all. The inability to obtain any third-party  license  required to develop
new  products and product  enhancements  could  require us to obtain  substitute
technology of lower quality or performance  standards or at greater cost, either
of which could seriously harm our ability to manufacture and sell our products.
