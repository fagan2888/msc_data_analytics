INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

         Communications technology has evolved from simple analog voice
signals transmitted over networks of copper telephone lines to complex analog
and digital voice and data signals transmitted over hybrid networks of media,
such as copper, coaxial and fiber optic cables. This evolution has been
driven by large increases in the number of users and the complexity and
variety of the data transmitted over networks, resulting from:

          -   the substantial growth in the Internet and its transformation from
              a text-based medium to a multimedia platform containing pictures,
              video and sound;

          -   the growth of wireless communications; and

          -   the increased demand for remote network access and higher speed,
              higher bandwidth communication between local area networks, or
              LANs, and wide area networks, or WANs.

         The majority of installed communications systems were designed to
transmit only voice communications, and are therefore inadequate for the
high-bandwidth transmission of both voice and data. As a result, new
equipment is being deployed to augment existing transmission media and
increase their bandwidth. Access to the public network is typically based on
asynchronous technologies, such as T/E carrier over copper wire. The demand
for greater bandwidth is driving a migration from lower-speed T1/E1 to
higher-speed T3/E3 transmission rates. The T1/E1 standard permits the
transmission of data at 1.5 Mbps/2.0 Mbps, and the T3/E3 standard permits the
transmission of data at 45 Mbps/34 Mbps. The backbone of the public network
is built on an optical fiber transmission medium that employs synchronous
technologies such as SONET/SDH. Similar to the utilization of faster
transmission rates over copper wire, SONET/SDH protocols such as OC-3 (155
Mbps) and OC-12 (622 Mbps) are being upgraded to OC-48 (2.5 Gbps) and OC-192
(10 Gbps) to increase the bandwidth over a single optical fiber.

         To address the evolving requirements of communications networks,
OEMs must develop and introduce increasingly sophisticated systems at a rapid
rate. To achieve the performance and functionality required of these systems,
communications OEMs utilize increasingly complex communications ICs, which
now account for a significant portion of the value-added proprietary content
of these systems. As a result of the rapid pace of new equipment
introductions, the proliferation of transmission standards, and the
difficulty of designing and producing these ICs, equipment suppliers are
increasingly outsourcing the design and production of the ICs incorporated
into their systems.

                                      2

         These trends have created a significant opportunity for IC suppliers
that can design cost-effective solutions for high-speed communications. The
worldwide T/E carrier IC market has experienced steady growth, and Dataquest
estimates that it will reach $616 million by 2003. The ATM IC market is
expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 28%, from $309 million
in 1998 to nearly $1.1 billion in 2003, according to Dataquest. The SONET/SDH
IC market reached $510 million in 1998, and Dataquest expects that it will
grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22% to $922 million by 2002.

         The key ICs contained in a typical communications system include
physical interface, access control, channel processor, bus interface and
switch fabric devices. The physical interface device consists of a
transmitter and receiver that, when integrated, is called a transceiver.
Transceivers interface with the physical transmission media, such as copper
wire or optical fiber. Most of these high-speed, mixed-signal ICs convert
parallel digital inputs into a single analog bit stream that is up to 32
times faster than the original signal. Transceivers therefore serve as a
bridge between analog transmission media and the digital devices that process
data. Access control circuits are digital ICs that format, or frame, the data
and perform error checking. The bus interface manages the transfer of data
along numerous channels between elements, such as the channel processor and
the switch fabric, which work together to shape, route and control the data.

         Because physical interface and access control ICs interface with the
transmission media and are critical to increasing bandwidth, these ICs must
offer high-speed and robust performance. Therefore, communications equipment
OEMs seek IC suppliers that possess extensive analog and digital expertise to
provide high-speed, mixed-signal solutions to bridge the analog physical
world and the digital computing environment. This must be coupled with
system-level expertise so that a supplier can quickly bring to market
high-performance, highly-reliable ICs with optimal feature sets.

Exar's communications products include transmitters and receivers,
transceivers, framers, ATM user network interfaces, or ATM UNIs, a jitter
attenuator and an M13 multiplexer. These products are used in SONET/SDH
multiplexers, private branch exchanges (PBX), central office switches and
digital cross connects. The Company introduced in early 1999 and began volume
production in October 1999 its second generation physical interface solution,
an integrated single chip transceiver. Subsequently, the Company announced a
dual channel and triple channel version of this transceiver that meets the
same performance levels while requiring less board space and lower overall
power in multi-port applications. The Company recently introduced its
integrated, single IC jitter attenuator, a proprietary solution that allows
OEMs to meet difficult jitter tolerance specifications while reducing overall
system costs. Exar's access control products include framers, ATM UNIs and an
M13 multiplexer. These newer products are achieving greater market acceptance
as Exar's strong transceiver products have allowed it to compete for adjacent

VIDEO AND IMAGING

         The video market is composed of several segments, including digital
still cameras, or DSCs, PC video cameras, security cameras, camcorders and
digital camcorders. Among these applications, one of the fastest growing
segments is DSCs, which Dataquest forecasts will grow from 6.2 million units
in 1999 to 13.0 million units in 2003. To create images that are more
comparable to film cameras and include features such as steady-shot and
digital zoom, DSCs and digital camcorders are requiring higher resolution and
higher speed data acquisition subsystems, also known as analog front ends, or
AFEs, and analog-to-digital converters, or ADCs.

         Exar supplies high-performance ADCs and integrated AFEs for products
such as DSCs, digital copiers, scanners and multifunctional peripherals, or
MFPs, which incorporate scanning, faxing and copying functions in a single
integrated system. The Company uses advanced design techniques and process
technologies to integrate low-power converter architectures with surrounding
analog functions, reducing total system cost.

         Through the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, no single customer
accounted for more than 10% of the Company's sales.


MANUFACTURING

         Exar outsources all of its fabrication and assembly, as well as the
majority of its testing operations. This fabless manufacturing model allows the
Company to focus on its core competencies of product design and development.

         The Company uses world-class independent wafer foundries, such as
Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, or Chartered, and Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. Chartered and TSMC manufacture all of the
Company's CMOS products. Rohm Co. Ltd. manufactures all of the Company's
Bipolar products and Chartered manufactures most of the Company's BiCMOS
products. The Company does not have long term supply agreements with Chartered
or TSMC. The Company's supply agreement with Rohm expires in 2006. The majority
of the Company's current products are implemented in standard CMOS. The Company
uses CMOS manufacturing processes to take advantage of that technology's lower
power consumption, cost-effectiveness, foundry availability and ever-increasing
speed. Currently, most of the Company's new product development is being
implemented in CMOS.

         Wafers are usually shipped to the Company's subcontractors in Asia for
wafer test and assembly, where they are cut into individual die and packaged.
Most of the Company's assembly work is performed by independent contractors in
Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan. Following assembly, final test
and quality assurance is performed either at the Company's Fremont, California
facility or at its subcontractors' facilities in Asia. The Company conducts
electrical testing of both wafers and packaged ICs. The combination of various
functions makes the test process for analog and mixed-signal devices
particularly difficult. Test operations require the programming, maintenance
and use of sophisticated computer-based test systems and complex automatic
handling systems.

         RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

         Exar believes that the continued introduction of new products in its
target markets is essential to its growth. As of March 31, 2000, the Company's
research and development staff consisted of 110 employees, 60 of whom hold
advanced engineering degrees. The Company has successfully recruited 24
engineers during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, while experiencing
minimal attrition. Over the next year, EXAR will seek to significantly increase
the Company's engineering headcount to add more design and application
personnel. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, the Company's
communications research and development spending increased 59.4% over the
previous fiscal year. To support its growth, Exar intends to continue spending
approximately 20% of revenue on research and development activities.

COMPETITION

         The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is
characterized by rapid technological change and a history of price reduction as
production efficiencies are achieved in successive generations of products.
Although the market for analog

                                      8

<PAGE>

and mixed-signal integrated circuits is generally characterized by longer
product life cycles and less dramatic price reductions than the market for
digital integrated circuits, the Company faces substantial competition in
each market in which the Company participates. Competition in the Company's
markets is based principally on technical innovation, product features,
timely introduction of new products, quality and reliability, performance,
price, technical support and service. The Company believes that it competes
favorably in all of these areas.

         Because the IC markets are highly fragmented, the Company generally
encounters different competitors in its various market areas. Competitors with
respect to the Company's communications products include Conexant, PMC-Sierra
and TranSwitch. In addition, the expansion of the Company's communications
product portfolio may in the future bring it into competition with other
established communications IC companies, such as Applied Micro Circuits Corp.
and Vitesse. Competitors in the Company's other markets include Analog Devices,
Philips and Texas Instruments.

BACKLOG

         Exar defines backlog to include OEM orders and distributor orders for
which a delivery schedule has been specified for product shipment occurring
primarily during the succeeding six months.

At March 31, 2000, Exar's backlog was approximately $20.6 million, compared
with $12.4 million at March 31, 1999. The increase in the Company's backlog was
primarily due to the growth in orders for communication devices.

Sales are made pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery of standard
items or agreements covering purchases over a period of time, which are
frequently subject to revision and cancellation. Lead times for the release of
purchase orders depend upon the scheduling practices of the individual
customer, and the rate of bookings varies from month to month. In addition,
Exar's distributor agreements generally permit the return of up to 10% of the
purchases annually for purposes of stock rotation and also provide for credits
to distributors in the event Exar reduces the price of any product. Because of
the possibility of changes in delivery schedules, quantity actually purchased,
cancellations of orders, distributor returns or price reductions, Exar's
backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual sales for
any succeeding period. Customers can cancel a significant portion of their
backlog at their discretion without substantial penalty.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

         The Company has 71 patents issued and 17 patent applications pending
in the U.S. The Company has 10 patents issued and 24 patent applications
pending in various foreign countries. None of the Company's domestic and
foreign patents that have been issued will expire in the near future unless the
Company chooses not to pay renewal fees. To protect the Company's intellectual
property, the Company also relies on a combination of mask work registrations,
trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure
agreements and licensing arrangements. The Company has also entered into
license agreements from time to time to gain access to externally developed
products or technologies.

         There can be no assurance that others will not independently develop
substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to the
Company's trade secrets or intellectual property, or disclose such intellectual
property or trade secrets, or that the Company can meaningfully protect its
intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the
Company's pending patent applications or any future applications will be
approved, or that any issued patents will provide the Company with competitive
advantages, or will not be challenged by third parties, or that if challenged,
will be found to be valid or enforceable, or that the patents of others will
not have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to do business.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not independently
develop similar products, duplicate the Company's products, or design around
any patents that may be issued to the Company.

         The Company cannot be sure that its products or technologies do not
infringe patents that may be granted in the future pursuant to pending patent
applications or that the Company's products do not infringe any patents or
proprietary rights of third parties. From time to time, the Company receives
communications from third parties alleging patent infringement. In the event
that any relevant claims of third-party patents are upheld as valid and
enforceable, the Company could be prevented from selling the Company's
products or could be required to obtain licenses from the owners of these
patents or be required to redesign the Company's products to avoid
infringement. The Company cannot assure you that licenses would be available
to the Company on acceptable terms, or at all, or that the Company would be
successful in any attempts to redesign its

                                      9

<PAGE>

products or processes to avoid infringement. The Company's failure to obtain
these licenses or to redesign the Company's products could harm its business.

EMPLOYEES

         As of March 31, 2000, the Company employed 276 full-time employees,
with 46 in administration, 110 in engineering and product development, 45 in
operations and 75 in marketing and sales. Of the 110 engineering and product
development employees, 60 hold advanced degrees. The Company's ability to
attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel is essential to its continued
success. None of the Company's employees is represented by a collective
bargaining agreement, nor has the Company ever experienced any work stoppage.
The Company believes its employee relations are good.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form
10-K and other reports filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, you should consider the following factors in evaluating the Company
and its business. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company's
business could be harmed. This could cause the price of EXAR's stock to
decline. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements
that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements about future plans,
objectives, intentions and expectations. Many factors, including those
described below, could cause actual results to differ materially from those
discussed in any forward-looking statement.

THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF
FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL.

         The Company's operating results fluctuate significantly. Some of the
factors that affect the Company's quarterly and annual results, many of which
are difficult to control or predict, are:

      -    the reduction, rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers;

      -    fluctuations in the timing and amount of customer requests for
           product shipments;

      -    fluctuations in the manufacturing output, yields and inventory levels
           of the Company's suppliers;

      -    changes in the mix of products that the Company's customers purchase;

      -    the Company's ability to introduce new products on a timely basis;

      -    the announcement or introduction of products by the Company's
           competitors;

      -    the availability of third-party foundry capacity and raw materials;

      -    competitive pressures on selling prices;

      -    the amounts and timing of costs associated with product warranties
           and returns;

      -    the amounts and timing of investments in research and development;

      -    market acceptance of the Company's products;


      -    costs associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired
           operations;

      -    the ability of the Company's customers to obtain components from
           their other suppliers;

      -    general conditions in the communications and semiconductor
           industries;

      -    fluctuations in interest rates; and

                                      13

<PAGE>

      -    general economic conditions.

THE COMPANY'S MARKETS ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE; THEREFORE, THE
COMPANY'S SUCCESS DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS.

         The markets for the Company's products are characterized by:

      -    rapidly changing technologies;

      -    changing customer needs;

      -    frequent new product introductions and enhancements;

      -    increased integration with other functions; and

      -    rapid product obsolescence.

         To develop new products for the Company's target markets, the Company
must develop, gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost-effective
and timely manner and continue to expand its technical and design expertise. In
addition, the Company must have its products designed into its customers'
future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in
order to develop new products that meet their changing needs.

         In addition, products for communications applications are based on
continually evolving industry standards. The Company's ability to compete will
depend on its ability to identify and ensure compliance with these industry
standards. As a result, the Company could be required to invest significant
time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign its products to
ensure compliance with relevant standards.

The Company cannot assure you that it will be able to identify new product
opportunities successfully, develop and bring to market new products, achieve
design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product
announcements by its competitors. In addition, the Company may not be
successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new
products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance. The Company's
pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and
expense. Failure in any of these areas could harm its operating results.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF ITS
KEY ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND ITS ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, HIRE AND
RETAIN ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL.

         There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the
semiconductor industry, in particular the highly skilled design, applications
and test engineers involved in the development of new communications ICs.
Competition is especially intense in the Silicon Valley, where the Company's
corporate headquarters is located. The Company may not be able to continue to
attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the
development of its business or to replace engineers or other qualified
personnel who may leave it's employ in the future. The Company's anticipated
growth is expected to place increased demands on its resources and will likely
require the addition of new management and engineering personnel and the
development of additional expertise by existing management personnel. Loss of
the services of, or failure to recruit, key engineers or other technical and
management personnel could harm its business.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THIRD PARTY FOUNDRIES TO MANUFACTURE ITS ICS.

The Company does not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility. Most
of its products are based on CMOS processes. Although two foundries manufacture
its products based on CMOS processes, most are manufactured at a single
foundry. In addition, one foundry manufactures most of the Company's BiCMOS
products. The Company does not have long-term wafer supply agreements with its
CMOS foundries that guarantee wafer or product quantities, prices, delivery or
lead times, as its CMOS foundries manufacture its products on a purchase order
basis. The Company provides these foundries with rolling forecasts of its
production requirements; however, the ability of each foundry to provide wafers
to the Company is limited by the foundry's available capacity. Therefore, the
Company's CMOS foundries could choose to

                                      14

<PAGE>

prioritize capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to
it on short notice. Accordingly, the Company cannot be certain that these
foundries will allocate sufficient capacity to satisfy its requirements. In
addition, the Company cannot be certain that it will continue to do business
with its foundries on terms as favorable as its current terms. Other
significant risks associated with the Company's reliance on third-party
foundries include:

      -    the lack of control over delivery schedules;

      -    the unavailability of, or delays in obtaining access to, key process
           technologies;

      -    limited control over quality assurance, manufacturing yields and
           production costs; and

      -    potential misappropriation of the Company's intellectual property.

         The Company could experience a substantial delay or interruption in
the shipment of its products or an increase in its costs due to the following:

      -    a sudden demand for semiconductor devices;

      -    a manufacturing disruption experienced by one or more of the
           Company's foundries or sudden reduction or elimination of any
           existing source or sources of semiconductor devices;

      -    time required to identify or qualify alternative manufacturing
           sources for existing or new products; or

      -    failure of the Company's suppliers to obtain the raw materials and
           equipment used in the production of its ICs.

TO SECURE FOUNDRY CAPACITY, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO FINANCIAL
AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WITH FOUNDRIES, AND SUCH AGREEMENTS MAY RESULT IN THE
DILUTION OF ITS EARNINGS OR THE OWNERSHIP OF ITS STOCKHOLDERS OR OTHERWISE HARM
ITS OPERATING RESULTS.

         Allocation of a foundry's manufacturing capacity may be influenced by
a customer's size or the existence of a long-term agreement with the foundry.
To address foundry capacity constraints, the Company and other semiconductor
companies that rely on third-party foundries have utilized various
arrangements, including equity investments in or loans to foundries in exchange
for guaranteed production capacity, joint ventures to own and operate
foundries, or "take or pay" contracts that commit a company to purchase
specified quantities of wafers over extended periods. While the Company is not
currently a party to any of these arrangements, it may decide to enter into
these arrangements in the future. The Company cannot be sure, however, that
these arrangements will be available to it on acceptable terms, if at all. Any
of these arrangements could require the Company to commit substantial capital
and, accordingly, could require it to obtain additional debt or equity
financing. This could result in the dilution of its earnings or the ownership
of its stockholders or otherwise harm its operating results.

IF THE COMPANY'S FOUNDRIES DISCONTINUE THE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES NEEDED TO
MEET ITS DEMANDS, OR FAIL TO UPGRADE THE TECHNOLOGIES NEEDED TO MANUFACTURE ITS
PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY FACE PRODUCTION DELAYS.

The Company's wafer and product requirements typically represent a small
portion of the total production of the foundries that manufacture its products.
As a result, the Company is subject to the risk that a foundry will cease
production on an older or lower-volume process that it uses to produce its
parts. Additionally, the Company cannot be certain its foundries will continue
to devote resources to the production of its products or continue to advance
the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of its products is
based. Each of these events could increase the Company's costs and harm its
ability to deliver its products on time.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE.

The Company's target markets are intensely competitive. The Company's ability
to compete successfully in its target markets depends on the following factors:

                                      15

<PAGE>

      -    designing new products that implement new technologies;

      -    subcontracting the manufacture of new products and delivering them in
           a timely manner;

      -    product quality and reliability;

      -    technical support and service;

      -    timely product introduction;

      -    product performance;

      -    product features;

      -    price;

      -    end-user acceptance of the Company's customers' products;

      -    compliance with evolving standards; and

      -    market acceptance of competitors' products.

         In addition, the Company's competitors or customers may offer new
products based on new technologies, industry standards or end-user or customer
requirements, including products that have the potential to replace or provide
lower-cost or higher-performance alternatives to its products. The introduction
of new products by the Company's competitors or customers could render the
Company's existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable. In addition,
the Company's competitors and customers may introduce products that integrate
the functions performed by its ICs on a single IC, thus eliminating the need
for the Company's products.

         Because the IC markets are highly fragmented, the Company generally
encounters different competitors in its various market areas. Competitors with
respect to the Company's communications products include Conexant Systems Inc.,
PMC-Sierra, Inc. and TranSwitch Corporation. In addition, the expansion of the
Company's communications product portfolio may in the future bring it into
competition with other established communications IC companies, such as Applied
Micro Circuits Corp. and Vitesse Semiconductor Corporation. Competitors in the
Company's other markets include Analog Devices Incorporated, Philips
Electronics and Texas Instruments Incorporated. Many of the Company's
competitors have greater financial, technical and management resources than the
Company does. Some of these competitors may be able to sell their products at
prices below which it would be profitable for the Company to sell its products.

IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO FURTHER PENETRATE THE MARKETS FOR COMMUNICATIONS
ICS, OR IF THESE MARKETS FAIL TO GROW AS EXPECTED, ITS REVENUES COULD STOP
GROWING AND MAY DECLINE.

         A significant portion of the Company's revenues in recent periods has
been, and is expected to continue to be, derived from sales of communications
ICs, particularly products based on the T/E carrier and ATM transmission
standards. In order for the Company to be successful, it must continue to
penetrate these markets. Furthermore, if these markets fail to grow as
expected, the Company's business could be harmed.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT REVENUES CURRENTLY DERIVED FROM NON-COMMUNICATIONS
PRODUCTS WILL DECLINE IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND ITS BUSINESS WILL BE HARMED IF ITS
COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS FAIL TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS DECLINE.

The Company does not intend to increase its funding of development efforts
relating to its video and imaging and other non-communications products, and as
a result revenues from these products may decline in future periods. In
addition, the markets for these products are subject to extreme price
competition, and the Company may not be able to reduce its costs in response to
declining average selling prices. Even if the Company reduces its costs, its
customers in these markets may not

                                      16

<PAGE>

purchase these products. Moreover, these markets may decrease in size in the
future. If the Company's communications products fail to compensate for any
revenue shortfall, its business could be harmed.

THE COMPANY'S DEPENDENCE ON THIRD-PARTY SUBCONTRACTORS TO ASSEMBLE AND TEST ITS
PRODUCTS SUBJECTS IT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS, INCLUDING AN INADEQUATE SUPPLY OF
PRODUCTS AND HIGHER MATERIALS COSTS.

The Company depends on independent subcontractors for the assembly and testing
of its products. The Company's reliance on these subcontractors involves the
following significant risks:

      -    reduced control over delivery schedules and quality;

      -    the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess
           demand;

      -    difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors;

      -    limited warranties on products supplied to the Company;

      -    potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages and other
           factors; and

      -    potential misappropriation of the Company's intellectual property.

         These risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs,
which would harm the Company's profitability and customer relationships.

THE COMPANY'S RELIANCE UPON FOREIGN SUPPLIERS EXPOSES IT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED
WITH INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

The Company uses semiconductor wafer foundries and assembly and test
subcontractors throughout Asia for most of its products. The Company intends to
continue transferring its testing and shipping operations to foreign
subcontractors. The Company's dependence on these subcontractors involves the
following substantial risks:

      -    political and economic instability;

      -    disruption to air transportation from Asia;

      -    changes in tax laws, tariffs and freight rates; and

      -    compliance with local or foreign regulatory reguirements.

         These risks may lead to delayed product delivery or increased costs,
which would harm the Company's profitability and customer relationships.

THE COMPANY'S RELIANCE ON FOREIGN CUSTOMERS COULD CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN ITS
OPERATING RESULTS.

         International sales accounted for 32.8% and 36.5% of net sales for
fiscal years 2000 and 1999, respectively. International sales may account for an
increasing portion of the Company's revenues, which would subject it to the
following risks:

      -    changes in regulatory requirements;

      -    tariffs and other barriers;

      -    timing and availability of export licenses;

      -    political and economic instability;

                                      17

<PAGE>

      -    difficulties in accounts receivable collections;

      -    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch
           operations;

      -    difficulties in managing distributors;

      -    difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for communications
           and other products;

      -    limited intellectual property protection;

      -    foreign currency exchange fluctuations;

      -    the burden of complying with and the risk of violating a wide variety
           of complex foreign laws and treaties; and

      -    potentially adverse tax consequences.

         In addition, because sales of the Company's products have been
denominated to date primarily in United States Dollars (except in Japan, where
the Company transacts a portion of its business in Japanese Yen), increases in
the value of the United States Dollar could increase the relative price of the
Company's products so that they become more expensive to customers in the local
currency of a particular country. Future international activity may result in
increased foreign currency denominated sales. Furthermore, because some of the
Company's customer purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws,
the Company may be limited in its ability to enforce its rights under these
agreements and to collect damages, if awarded.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON ITS DISTRIBUTORS AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES TO SELL MANY
OF ITS PRODUCTS.

The Company sells many of its products through distributors and sales
representatives. The Company's distributors and sales representatives could
reduce or discontinue sales of its products. They may not devote the resources
necessary to sell the Company's products in the volumes and within the time
frames that it expects. In addition, the Company depends upon the continued
viability and financial resources of these distributors and sales
representatives, some of which are small organizations with limited working
capital. These distributors and sales representatives, in turn, depend
substantially on general economic conditions and conditions within the
semiconductor industry. The Company believes that its success will continue to
depend upon these distributors and sales representatives. If some or all of the
Company's distributors and sales representatives experience financial
difficulties, or otherwise become unable or unwilling to promote and sell its
products, the Company's business could be harmed.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S COMMUNICATIONS ICS TYPICALLY HAVE LENGTHY SALES CYCLES,
THE COMPANY MAY EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL DELAYS BETWEEN INCURRING EXPENSES
RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE GENERATION OF SALES REVENUE.

         Due to the communications IC product cycle, it usually takes the
Company more than 12 months to realize volume shipments after it first contacts
a customer. The Company first works with customers to achieve a design win,
which may take nine months or longer. The Company's customers then complete the
design, testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production, a
period which typically lasts an additional three months or longer. As a result,
a significant period of time may elapse between the Company's research and
development efforts and its realization of revenue, if any, from volume
purchasing of the Company's communications products by its customers.

THE COMPANY'S BACKLOG MAY NOT RESULT IN FUTURE REVENUE.

         Due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and
cancellations of orders, the Company's backlog at any particular date is not
necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. A reduction
of backlog during any particular period, or the failure of the Company's
backlog to result in future revenue, could harm the Company's business.

                                      18

<PAGE>

THE COMPANY'S OPERATING EXPENSES ARE RELATIVELY FIXED, AND IT MAY ORDER
MATERIALS IN ADVANCE OF ANTICIPATED CUSTOMER DEMAND. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY HAS
LIMITED ABILITY TO REDUCE EXPENSES QUICKLY IN RESPONSE TO ANY REVENUE
SHORTFALLS.

         The Company's operating expenses are relatively fixed, and, therefore,
it has limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue
shortfalls. Consequently, the Company's operating results will be harmed if its
revenues do not meet its revenue projections. The Company may experience
revenue shortfalls for the following reasons:

      -    significant pricing pressures that occur because of declines in
           average selling prices over the life of a product;

      -    sudden shortages of raw materials or fabrication, test or assembly
           capacity constraints that lead the Company's suppliers to allocate
           available supplies or capacity to other customers and, in turn, harm
           the Company's ability to meet its sales obligations; and

      -    the reduction, rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders.

         In addition, the Company typically plans its production and inventory
levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which is highly
unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. From time to time, in response
to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from the
Company's outside suppliers and foundries, it may order materials in advance of
anticipated customer demand. This advance ordering may result in excess
inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write-downs if expected orders fail
to materialize.

PERIODS OF RAPID GROWTH AND EXPANSION COULD CONTINUE TO PLACE A SIGNIFICANT
STRAIN ON THE COMPANY'S LIMITED PERSONNEL AND OTHER RESOURCES.

         To manage the Company's possible future growth effectively, the
Company will be required to continue to improve its operational, financial and
management systems and to successfully hire, train, motivate and manage its
employees. In addition, the integration of past and future potential
acquisitions and the evolution of the Company's business plan will require
significant additional management, technical and administrative resources. The
Company cannot be certain that it will be able to manage the growth and
evolution of its current business effectively.

EXAR HAS IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE MAKE ACQUISITIONS, WHICH WILL
INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS. EXAR CANNOT ASSURE THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS
THESE RISKS SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE, DELAY OR OTHER
OPERATIONAL OR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.

         The risks involved with acquisitions include:

      -    diversion of management's attention;

      -    failure to retain key personnel;

      -    amortization of acquired intangible assets;

      -    customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired
           company;

      -    the cost associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired
           operations; and

      -    assumption of known or unknown liabilities or other unanticipated
           events or circumstances.

The Company cannot assure that it will be able to address these risks
successfully without substantial expense, delay or other operational or
financial problems.

                                      19
<PAGE>

THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
ADEQUATELY.

The Company's ability to compete is affected by its ability to protect its
intellectual property rights. The Company relies on a combination of patents,
trademarks, copyrights, mask work registrations, trade secrets, confidentiality
procedures and non-disclosure and licensing arrangements to protect its
intellectual property rights. Despite these efforts, the Company cannot be
certain that the steps it takes to protect its proprietary information will be
adequate to prevent misappropriation of the Company's technology, or that its
competitors will not independently develop technology that is substantially
similar or superior to the Company's technology.

         More specifically, the Company cannot be sure that its pending patent
applications or any future applications will be approved, or that any issued
patents will provide it with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by
third parties. Nor can the Company be sure that, if challenged, the Company's
patents will be found to be valid or enforceable, or that the patents of others
will not have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to do business.
Furthermore, others may independently develop similar products or processes,
duplicate the Company's products or processes or design around any patents that
may be issued to it.

THE COMPANY COULD BE HARMED BY LITIGATION INVOLVING PATENTS AND OTHER
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

         As a general matter, the semiconductor industry is characterized by
substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.
The Company may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of
third parties. Furthermore, the Company has certain indemnification obligations
to customers with respect to the infringement of third-party intellectual
property rights by its products. The Company cannot be certain that infringement
claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users
of its products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the
future or that such assertions, if proven to be true, will not harm its
business.

         Any litigation relating to the intellectual property rights of third
parties, whether or not determined in the Company's favor or settled by the
Company, would at a minimum be costly and could divert the efforts and attention
of its management and technical personnel. In the event of any adverse ruling in
any such litigation, the Company could be required to pay substantial damages,
cease the manufacturing, use and sale of infringing products, discontinue the
use of certain processes or obtain a license under the intellectual property
rights of the third party claiming infringement. A license might not be
available on reasonable terms, or at all.

EARTHQUAKES AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS MAY DAMAGE THE COMPANY'S FACILITIES OR
THOSE OF ITS SUPPLIERS.

The Company's corporate headquarters in Fremont, California is located near
major earthquake faults that have experienced earthquakes in the past. In
addition, some of its suppliers are located near fault lines. In the event of a
major earthquake or other natural disaster near its headquarters, the Company's
operations could be harmed. Similarly, a major earthquake or other natural
disaster near one or more of the Company's major suppliers, like the one that
occurred in Taiwan in September 1999, could disrupt the operations of those
suppliers, which could limit the supply of the Company's products and harm its
business.

THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE.

         The market price of the Company's common stock has fluctuated
significantly to date. In the future, the market price of its common stock could
be subject to significant fluctuations due to:

         -    quarter-to-quarter variations in the Company's anticipated or
              actual operating results;

         -    announcements or introductions of new products;

         -    technological innovations or setbacks by the Company or its
              competitors;

         -    conditions in the communications and semiconductor markets;

                                      20

<PAGE>

         -   the commencement of litigation;

         -   changes in estimates of the Company's performance by securities
             analysts;

         -   announcements of merger or acquisition transactions; and

         -   general economic and market conditions.

         In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme
price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high
technology companies, including semiconductor companies, and that have often
been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies.
These fluctuations may harm the market price of the Company's common stock.

THE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF THE COMPANY'S CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND
OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW MAY DELAY, DEFER OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF
CONTROL.

The Company's board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2,250,000
shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and
privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without
any further vote or action by its stockholders. The rights of the holders of
common stock will be subject to, and may be harmed by, the rights of the holders
of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance
of preferred stock may delay, defer or prevent a change in control, as the terms
of the preferred stock that might be issued could potentially prohibit the
Company's consummation of any merger, reorganization, sale of substantially all
of its assets, liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction without
the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred stock. In
addition, the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on the
Company's stockholders. The Company's stockholders must give 120 days advance
notice prior to the relevant meeting to nominate a candidate for director or
present a proposal to the Company's stockholders at a meeting. These notice
requirements could inhibit a takeover by delaying stockholder action. The
Company may trigger its stockholder rights plan in the event its board of
directors does not agree to an acquisition proposal. The rights plan may make it
more difficult and costly to acquire the Company. The Delaware anti-takeover law
restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder
acquires 15% or more of the Company's common stock. The Delaware statute makes
it more difficult for the Company to be acquired without the consent of its
board of directors and management.

IF THE COMPANY HAS NOT ADEQUATELY PREPARED FOR THE TRANSITION TO YEAR 2000, ITS
BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD SUFFER.

         The Company has executed a plan designed to make its computer systems,
applications, computer and manufacturing equipment and facilities Year 2000
ready. To date, none of the Company's systems, applications, equipment or
facilities have experienced material difficulties from the transition to Year
2000, nor has the Company been notified that any of its suppliers have had any
such difficulties. However, due to the breadth of potential issues related to
the Year 2000, the Company cannot guarantee that it will not experience any
problems in the future and the final determination may take several months.
Where practicable, the Company has attempted to mitigate its risks with respect
to any failures of its critical external suppliers related to the Year 2000. The
effect on the Company's results of operations from any failure of its systems,
applications, equipment or facilities, or its critical external suppliers,
related to the Year 2000 issue cannot yet be determined.
