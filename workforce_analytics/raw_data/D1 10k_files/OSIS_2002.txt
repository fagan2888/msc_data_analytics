Industry Overview 
 
The Company’s security products and medical imaging and monitoring systems are sold primarily to end-users, while the Company’s optoelectronic devices and subsystems are designed and manufactured primarily for sale to OEMs. 
 
Security and Inspection Products.    A variety of products are currently used worldwide in security and inspection applications. These products include single energy x-ray equipment, dual energy x-ray equipment, metal detectors, trace detection systems that detect particulate and chemical traces of explosive materials, computed tomography (“CT”) scanners, x-ray machines employing backscatter detection technology, and cargo inspection systems using x-rays or gamma rays. The Company believes that the growth in the market for security and inspection products will continue to be driven by the increased perception of threat fueled by terrorist incidents, increased government mandates and appropriations, and the emergence of a growing market for the non-security applications of its products such as customs manifest verification and agricultural products inspection. 
 
In the 1970s, principally in response to civilian airline hijackings, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) established security standards by setting guidelines for the screening of carry-on baggage for weapons such as guns and knives. These standards were later mandated by the United Nations for adoption by all of its member states. The Company believes that to date the imposition of these standards has resulted in the installation of over 10,000 x-ray inspection systems in airports worldwide. Additionally, the United Kingdom Department of Transport has required the United Kingdom’s commercial airports to deploy systems for 100% screening of international checked baggage since the end of 1998, and the European Civil Aviation Conference, an organization of 33 member states, has agreed to implement 100% screening of international checked baggage in the future. 
 
In the United States, largely in response to the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 in December 1988, Congress enacted the Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990, which, among other initiatives, directed the FAA to establish and implement strict security measures and to deploy advanced technology for the detection of explosives. In July 1996, President Clinton formed the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security (the “Gore Commission”) to review airline and airport security and to oversee aviation safety. In response to the initial report released by the Gore

Table of Contents
Commission, the United States enacted legislation that included $144 million in appropriations for the initial deployment of advanced security and inspection technology at major U.S. airports. A portion of this funding is allocated for Threat Image Projection (TIP) Ready X-ray (TRX) systems at security checkpoints throughout the nation. 
 
The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon using hijacked airliners has led to nation-wide shifts in air and ground transportation security, and facilities security policies, including passage of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, and the potential integration of all U.S. domestic security-related agencies into a single umbrella department. These changes have caused an increase in security measures, which in turn has resulted in an increase in sales of the Company’s security and inspection products as compared to pre-September 11, 2001 levels. 
 
In April 2000, the Company was awarded a contract by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) to provide x-ray screening systems at selected airports throughout the United States. Under the contract, the FAA has the right to purchase up to 800 systems, for which the purchase price would be approximately $40 million. In fiscal years 2001 and 2002, the Company filled two orders for more than 300 systems under this contract. The Company holds an additional order for more than 100 systems, some of which were shipped in fiscal 2002, and the balance will be shipped in fiscal 2003. 
 
X-ray inspection equipment, such as that sold by the Company, is also increasingly being used for a number of purposes not related to security. Newer versions of x-ray inspection equipment combine x-ray inspection with computer image enhancement capabilities and can be applied to various non-security purposes such as the detection of narcotics, gold and currency, the inspection of agricultural products, and the inspection of cargo by customs officers and international shippers. 
 
General trends toward increased international trade and international transportation of goods and people have led to an increase in demand for cargo, port and border inspection technologies. The Company currently markets cargo, port and border inspection systems through Rapiscan’s Cargo Inspection Group, including projects currently underway in Hong Kong, Romania, Malaysia and Korea. 
 
Optoelectronic Devices and Subsystems.    Optoelectronic devices consist of both active components, such as silicon photodiodes that sense light of varying wavelengths and convert the light detected into electronic signals, and passive components, such as lenses, prisms, filters and mirrors. An optoelectronic subsystem typically consists of one or more optoelectronic devices that are combined with other electronic components for integration into an end-product. Optoelectronic devices and subsystems, and medical imaging systems are used for a wide variety of applications ranging from simple functions, such as the detection of paper in the print path of a laser printer, to complex monitoring, measurement or positioning functions, such as in industrial robotics where the subsystem is used to detect the exact position, motion or size of another object. Because optoelectronic devices and subsystems can be used in a wide variety of measurement control and monitoring applications, optoelectronics may be used in a broad array of industrial applications. Optoelectronic devices also are key components in the telecommunications and fiber optics market. 
 
The Company believes that in recent years, advances in technology and reductions in the cost of key components of optoelectronic systems, including computer processing power and memory, have broadened the market by enabling the use of optoelectronic devices in a greater number of applications. In addition, the Company believes that there is a trend among OEMs to increasingly outsource the design and manufacture of optoelectronic subsystems to fully-integrated, independent manufacturers who may have greater specialization, broader expertise, and the ability and flexibility to respond in shorter time periods than the OEM could accomplish in-house. The Company believes that its high level of vertical integration, substantial engineering resources, expertise in the use and application of optoelectronic technology, and low-cost international manufacturing operations enable it to compete in the market for optoelectronic devices and subsystems.

Through a majority-owned subsidiary, RapiTec, Inc., the Company has penetrated the worldwide weapons simulation market through system engineering, product development, rapid prototyping, and volume manufacturing for state-of-the-art, laser-based training systems for the defense industry. 
 
The Company has developed high-speed silicon photodiodes for use in fiber optic systems such as Gigabit Ethernet and Fiber Channel systems. These products can replace Gallium Arsenide products at about half the cost. The Company has developed a silicon-based fiber optic detector, which can achieve a 2.5 Gigabit/second data rate using 3.3 volts bias voltage. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, OSI Fibercomm, Inc., the Company has launched a new family of Indium Gallium Arsenide photodetectors for use in a variety of network applications and long-haul communications applications, together with high-speed silicon-based detectors combined with transimpedence amplifiers (“TIA”). 
 
Medical Diagnostic and Imaging Systems.    The Company has expanded into medical diagnostic and imaging systems. The Company manufactures and distributes the DTX 200 (DEXACARE), a U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”)-approved forearm DEXA (Dual Energy X-Ray) densitometer, which is used to diagnose osteoporosis as well as to provide follow-up bone density measurements. The Company also produces the ultrasound DTU-One, the first commercially available ultrasound scanner using imaging capability for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. In September 2000, the Company received pre-market approval (“PMA”) from the FDA to sell the DTU-One in the United States. The Company also received 510(k) approval from the FDA to sell its new dual energy x-ray based technology tabletop bone densitometer, DexaCare G4. 
 
The Company also acquired majority ownership of TFT Medical, Inc., which has been renamed “OSI Medical, Inc.” (“OSI Medical”), which is currently developing next-generation pulse oximeter instruments and probes for use in the medical field. The Company presently manufactures a number of medical devices through several of its subsidiaries, some of which are described above, and in July 2001, the Company formed a new subsidiary, Dolphin Medical, Inc., for the purpose of consolidating its various medical oximetry devices into a single subsidiary. In September 2001, the medical device business of the Company’s UDT Sensors, Inc. subsidiary was contributed to Dolphin Medical, Inc. in exchange for stock in Dolphin Medical, Inc. OSI Medical (formerly TFT Medical) was merged into Dolphin Medical in March 2002. After the merger of OSI Medical into Dolphin Medical, the Company owns approximately  93.7% share of Dolphin Medical. 
 
Growth Strategy 
 
The Company’s primary objectives are to be a leading provider of security and inspection products and specialized optoelectronic products, to enhance its position in the international inspection and detection marketplace and to leverage its expertise in the optoelectronic technology industry by entering into new end-product markets on a selective basis. Key elements of this strategy include: 
 
Capitalize on the Growing Market for Security and Inspection Products.    The Company believes that the increase in awareness of terrorist and other security threats may continue to drive growth in the market for security and inspection products, not only in transportation security, but in facilities security, event security and materials inspection as well. In addition, the trend toward increased international transportation of goods and people may result in growth in the market for cargo inspection systems. Package screening by freight forwarders also represents a potential growing sector, as new regulations in Europe require such screening, and awareness of the need for such screening grows in the U.S. The Company intends to continue to expand its sales and marketing efforts both domestically and internationally, and to capitalize on opportunities to replace, service and upgrade existing security installations. 
 
Expand Security and Inspection Business into New Markets.    The Company intends to continue to expand sales of its security and inspection products in non-traditional applications, including sales of its products in the industrial inspection market such as agricultural products inspection. In addition, through research and development and selective acquisitions, the Company may enhance and expand its current product offering to better address new applications. 
 
Leverage its Optoelectronic Design and Manufacturing Expertise to Address New Applications.    The Company believes that one of its primary competitive strengths is its expertise in designing and manufacturing specialized optoelectronic subsystems for its own end products and for its OEM customers in a cost-effective manner. The Company currently designs and manufactures devices and subsystems for more than 200 customers serving more than 100 applications. The Company has developed this expertise in the past through internal research and development efforts

and through selective acquisitions. In 1987, the Company formed Opto Sensors (Singapore) PTE Ltd. (“OSI Singapore”) to manufacture optoelectronic devices and subsystems. In 1990, the Company acquired UDT Sensors, Inc. (“UDT Sensors”) to broaden its expertise and capabilities in developing and manufacturing optoelectronic devices and subsystems. In 1993, the Company acquired Rapiscan Security Products Limited (“Rapiscan U.K.”) and, through Rapiscan Security Products (U.S.A.), Inc. (“Rapiscan U.S.A.”) (Rapiscan U.S.A. and Rapiscan U.K. are sometimes collectively referred to as “Rapiscan”), commenced its operations as a provider of security and inspection products in the United States. Thereafter, in 1993, the Company acquired Ferson Optics, Inc. (“Ferson Optics”) for its passive optic technologies. In 1994, the Company commenced operations of Opto Sensors (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. (“OSI Malaysia”) to take advantage of low cost manufacturing. In 1997, the Company acquired Advanced Micro Electronics AS (“AME”) for AME’s hybrid optoelectronic capabilities. 
 
In September 1998, the Company acquired Osteometer, a Danish manufacturer of diagnostic scanners used for the early detection of symptoms of osteoporosis. Osteometer concentrates on the development of small, cost-optimized scanners making it possible for small clinics to offer their patients a cost-effective early detection of osteoporosis and is committed to the development of scientifically and clinically validated devices that result in accurate, precise, reliable and cost-effective diagnosis. Due to the global decline in the bone densitometer market, in August 1999 the Company decided to close the operations of Osteometer in Denmark, and relocate certain of these operations to the Company’s U.S. facilities. In the quarter ended September 30, 1999, the Company recorded estimated restructuring costs of $1.9 million related to the closure of the Osteometer facility in Denmark. These costs were associated primarily with the termination of certain employees, commitments and other facility closure costs. During the quarter ended March 31, 2000, the Company completed the closure of the Osteometer facility in Denmark and the relocation of the operations to the United States. The market for osteoporosis diagnostic equipment is currently weak and is expected to remain so for at least the near-term. 
 
In November 1998, the Company purchased the security products business of Metorex International Oy (“Metorex Security”) of Espoo, Finland. The Company paid $4.7 million in cash, including professional fees associated with the acquisition. In July 1999, the Company paid 4.4 million Finnish markka (approximately $739,000), in lieu of contingent payments of up to $1.5 million, based on future sales. The acquisition of Metorex Security brought a complete security metal detection product line to the Company. Metor brand security archway metal detectors are among the most widely recognized such products in the world. These metal detectors complement the x-ray screening systems supplied by Rapiscan. Metorex Security continues to supply a large number of systems to the U.S. Government, as well as to customers around the world. The products include Metor 100 series archways, as well as Metor 200 series zonal archways. The Company’s MetorNet™ product allows monitoring and control of multi-system installations. 
 
In November 1998, the Company acquired all the outstanding stock of Silicon Microstructures, Inc. (“SMI”), a silicon pressure-sensor manufacturer, from Exar Corporation of Fremont, California. The Company paid $2.7 million in cash, including professional fees associated with the acquisition. On March 31, 2001, the Company sold all of the outstanding stock of SMI to Elmos Semiconductor AG of Germany for $6 million in cash. In connection with this transaction, the Company’s UDT subsidiary sold certain capital equipment to SMI for $462,000 in cash. The sale also includes a three-year commitment from UDT to supply four-inch silicon foundry wafers to SMI and to dedicate limited manufacturing facilities to be used by SMI for its etching operations, a commitment which will terminate in March 2004. The total pre-tax gain on the transaction was approximately $3 million. In July 2002, SMI served a notice to UDT terminating the commitment. UDT is presently negotiating with SMI and does not anticipate any material effect upon termination of such commitment. 
 
In December 1998, the Company acquired most of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Corrigan Canada Ltd. (“Corrigan”), a Canadian security products manufacturer, for approximately $476,000 in cash, including professional fees associated with the acquisition. 
 
In January 1999, the Company acquired Aristo Medical Products, Inc. (“Aristo”) for approximately $277,000 in cash, including professional fees associated with the acquisition. Aristo develops and manufactures next generation pulse oximeter probes used in the medical field. 
 
In August 1998, the Company invested $315,000, including professional fees associated with the acquisition, in Square One, Inc. (“Square One”) for an equity share of approximately 16%, and in August 2000, the Company acquired substantially all of its assets for consideration of $259,000 in cash, including professional fees associated with the acquisition, future royalties (on which a $30,000 advance payment was made), and return of the Square One stock held

by the Company. The acquired business develops and manufactures infrared-based patient monitoring medical subsystems. 
 
During fiscal 1999, the Company invested $1.0 million, including professional fees associated with the acquisition, in OSI Medical for an equity share of approximately 40%. OSI Medical develops next generation pulse oximeter instruments and probes for use in the medical field. Pursuant to an agreement entered into as of October 4, 1999 (the “OSI Medical Agreement”) the Company acquired an additional equity interest, representing approximately 16% of the stock ownership of OSI Medical for $1.2 million, including professional fees associated with the acquisition. During Fiscal 2001, the Company acquired additional equity interest representing approximately 19% of the ownership of OSI Medical for $282,000. With these additional equity investments, the Company increased its equity share in OSI Medical to approximately 75%. On April 12, 2000, also pursuant to the OSI Medical Agreement and in connection with certain amounts loaned or to be loaned by the Company to OSI Medical thereunder, the Company also acquired five-year warrants (subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain events) to acquire up to 1,110,000 additional OSI Medical shares at a purchase price of $1.35 per share. The warrants, if fully exercised, would result in the Company’s share in OSI Medical being increased to over 78%, based upon the number of shares presently outstanding. Also, pursuant to the OSI Medical Agreement, the Company has an option to acquire all of OSI Medical. 
 
The Company presently manufactures a number of medical devices through several of its subsidiaries, some of which are described above, and has recently formed a new subsidiary, Dolphin Medical, Inc., for the purpose of consolidating its various medical devices in a single subsidiary. In September 2001, the medical device business of the Company’s UDT Sensors, Inc. subsidiary was contributed to Dolphin Medical, Inc. in exchange for stock in Dolphin Medical Inc. OSI Medical was merged into Dolphin Medical in March 2002. Outstanding warrants to purchase additional OSI Medical shares expired without being exercised. After the merger of OSI Medical into Dolphin Medical, the Company owns approximately 93.7% share of Dolphin Medical. 
 
In July 2002, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of Thermo Centro Vision, Inc., an optoelectronic subsystems designer and manufacturer based in Ventura County, California, for an initial purchase price of $1.45 million. The acquisition was made through a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, Centro Vision. The Company may pay up to an additional $800,000 in cash at a later date based on future sales by Centro Vision. 
 
In July 2002, the Company purchased from Imagis Technologies, Inc. (“Imagis”) 1,166,667 shares of its common stock (approximately 6% of its outstanding stock), 2-year warrants to purchase 291,667 additional shares of Imagis common stock (approximately 1.5% of its presently-outstanding stock) at a price of $1.50 per share, and certain ancillary rights for $1.75 million. Imagis develops facial recognition software for security applications. 
 
In fiscal 2002, the Company entered into discussions regarding a joint acquisition by the Company and L-3 Communications Corporation (“L-3”) of certain detection and security businesses then owned by PerkinElmer, Inc. (“PerkinElmer”). The transaction as contemplated would result in the Company’s acquisition from L-3 of a certain portion of PerkinElmer’s detection and security businesses. L-3 completed the purchase of the businesses from PerkinElmer in June 2002. In September 2002, L-3 and the Company received clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Pre-Merger Notification Act for L-3 to sell such businesses to the Company. The Company is currently conducting due diligence and continuing the negotiation of a definitive agreement for the purchase of the assets. There can be no assurance as to when or if the acquisition will be completed. 
 
The Company intends to continue to build its expertise in order to address a greater number of applications. By expanding the number of potential applications its products may serve, the Company intends to increase its business with existing customers and by attracting new customers. 
 
The Company has developed high-speed silicon photodiodes for use in fiber optic systems such as Gigabit Ethernet and Fiber Channel systems. These products can replace Gallium Arsenide products at about half the cost. The Company has developed a silicon-based fiber optic detector, which can achieve a 2.5 Gigabit/second data rate using 3.3 volts bias voltage. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, OSI Fibercomm, Inc., the Company has launched a new family of Indium

Gallium Arsenide photodetectors for use in a variety of network applications and long-haul communications applications, together with light speed silicon-based detectors combined with transimpedence amplifiers (“TIA”). 
 
The Company believes that its strategy will enable it to take advantage of the growth certain existing markets are experiencing and to benefit from additional growth that these new and enhanced products will provide. 
 
Capitalize on Vertical Integration.    The Company’s vertical integration provides several other advantages in both its optoelectronic devices and subsystems and security and detection product lines. These advantages include reduced manufacturing and delivery times, lower costs due to its access to competitive international labor markets and direct sourcing of raw materials, and quality control. The Company also believes that it offers significant added value to its OEM customers by providing a full range of vertically-integrated services including component design and customization, subsystem concept design and application engineering, product prototyping and development, and efficient pre-production, short-run and high volume manufacturing. The Company believes that its vertical integration differentiates it from many of its competitors and provides value to its OEM customers, who can rely on the Company to be an integrated supplier of an optoelectronic subsystem. The Company intends to continue to leverage its vertically integrated services to create greater value for its customers in the design and manufacture of its products. The Company believes that this strategy better positions the Company for penetration into other end markets. 
 
Capitalize on Global Presence.    The Company operates from locations in the United States, Europe, Asia and Canada. The Company views its international operations as providing an important strategic advantage over competitors in both the optoelectronic device and subsystem market and the security and inspection market for three primary reasons. First, international manufacturing facilities allow the Company to take advantage of competitive labor rates in order to be a low cost producer. Second, its international offices strengthen its sales and marketing efforts and its ability to service and repair its systems by providing direct access to growing foreign markets and to its existing international customer base. Third, multiple manufacturing locations allow the Company to reduce delivery times to its global customer base. In the future, the Company intends to develop new sources of manufacturing and sales capabilities to maintain and enhance the benefits of its international presence. 
 
Selectively Enter New End Markets.    Similar to the Company’s expansion during fiscal 1998 into optoelectronic products for medical diagnostic applications, the Company intends to selectively enter new end markets that complement its existing capabilities in designing, developing and manufacturing optoelectronic devices and subsystems. The Company believes that by manufacturing other end products, which rely on the technological capabilities of the Company, it can leverage its existing integrated design and manufacturing infrastructure to capture greater margins and build a significant presence in new end markets which present attractive competitive market dynamics. The Company intends to achieve this strategy through internal growth and through selective acquisitions of end-product manufacturers. 
 
Products and Technology 
 
The Company designs, develops, manufactures and sells products ranging from complex x-ray security and inspection products, medical imaging and monitoring systems and discrete devices to value-added subsystems. 
 
Security and Inspection Equipment.    The Company manufactures and sells a range of security and inspection equipment that it markets under the “Rapiscan,” “Secure” and “Metor” brand names. Traditionally, the primary market for these products was in aviation security. In recent years, and especially after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, security and inspection products have increasingly been used at a wide range of facilities other than airports and for event security purposes as well. Moreover, the non-security use of such equipment, such as manifest verification by customs agencies at border crossings, or agricultural products inspection, has also grown. Aided by the evolving markets for security and inspection products, the Company has successfully diversified sales channels for its security and inspection products. Of the Company’s security and inspection revenues, the percentage derived from the sale of inspection products to airlines and airports was approximately 26.1% in fiscal year 2000, 28.3% in fiscal year 2001 and 24.5% in fiscal year 2002, and the balance of such revenues were derived from all other sales. 
 
The Company’s inspection and detection products combine the use of x-ray technology with the Company’s optoelectronic capabilities. The Company’s products combine dual or multi-energy x-ray technology with computer enhanced imaging technology to facilitate the detection of materials such as explosives, narcotics, currency or other contraband. While all x-ray systems produce a two-dimensional image of the contents of the inspected material, the dual-energy x-ray systems also measure the x-ray absorption of the inspected materials’ contents at two x-ray energies to

Table of Contents
determine the atomic number, mass and other characteristics of the object’s contents. The different organic and non-organic substances in the inspected material are displayed in various colors. This information is then displayed to an operator of the inspection equipment who can identify and differentiate the objects in the inspected materials. These systems range in size from compact tabletop systems to large cargo, port and border inspection systems comprising entire buildings through which the subject trucks, shipping containers or pallets are transported. 
 
All of the Company’s currently-marketed inspection products require an operator to monitor the images produced by the inspection equipment. Depending on the model, the Company’s products permit the operator to inspect the contents of packages at varying image modes and magnifications. The images range from the monochrome and pseudo-color images produced by single energy x-ray imaging systems, to high resolution, multi-color images in the Company’s computer enhanced dual-energy models. The Company believes that its Rapiscan 500 Series provides one of the highest quality images currently available in the x-ray security and inspection industry. 
 
With the acquisition of Metorex Security, the Company acquired walk-through metal detection systems, which utilize pulse induced magnetic fields combined with microprocessor based electronics, which provide uniform detection of ferrous and non-ferrous metallic objects. The technologies range from dual-channel crossed magnetic fields to multi-zone coil configuration. 
 
In the field of inspection of people, the Company’s “Secure” brand product line uses x-ray systems employing backscatter detection technology. Secure 1000 is an electronic screening system for hands-off personal scanning. The system is based on an extremely low dose of backscatter x-ray imaging to detect contraband and weapons concealed underneath clothing and hair. The system provides better screening than metal detectors as it detects very small amounts of metal as well as non-metallic items. 
 
The Company also develops and markets security and inspection systems for cargo, port and border applications using x-ray or gamma ray technology and computer-enhanced imaging (collectively referred to as “cargo systems”). Such systems are primarily used to verify the contents of trucks or cargo containers, and to detect the presence of any contraband. Cargo systems offer significant improvements over historical methods of cargo screening, such as manual searches, as they are faster, more thorough, and do not subject the cargo to pilferage. Entire shipping containers or trucks can be screened in a matter of minutes. The Company’s cargo systems currently include fixed site systems, relocatable systems, and mobile systems. 
 
Fixed-site systems comprise a building through which trucks or containers are transported for inspection. Fixed-site system projects installed or currently under construction include two systems at Lok Ma Chau in Hong Kong. Relocatable systems function similarly to fixed-site systems, but are housed in structures that can be relocated among pre-constructed pads, thereby enabling the deployment of the system where traffic may be heaviest at a given time, while saving the cost of building multiple systems. Relocatable systems currently under construction include two systems in South Korea for the Korean Customs Service. 
 
Mobile systems are truck-mounted systems using x-ray or gamma-ray sources for the inspection of vehicles or cargo containers. The mobile systems can be quickly transported and redeployed as needed. Mobile systems currently being built include two units for Romania in a World Bank-funded project, and several units for the Malaysian Customs. 
 
In order to monitor the performance of operators of the x-ray baggage screening systems that are used in the United States airports, the FAA has implemented a computer-based training and evaluation program known as the Screener Proficiency Evaluation And Reporting System (“SPEARS”). To continuously monitor the effectiveness of the screening system and its operator, simulated threat images, such as weapons, are projected into the images of actual parcels being inspected. The results of these tests are available to government agencies. In fiscal years 2001 and 2002, the Company filled two orders for over 300 systems under this contract. The Company holds an additional order for more than 100 systems, some of which were shipped in fiscal 2002, and the balance will be shipped in fiscal 2003. 
 
The following table sets forth certain information related to the standard security and inspection products currently offered by the Company. The Company does, however, also customize its standard products to suit specific applications and customer requirements:

Discrete Devices and Subsystems, and Medical Imaging Systems.    Optoelectronic devices generally consist of both active and passive components. Active components sense light of varying wavelengths and convert the light detected into electronic signals, whereas passive components amplify, separate or reflect light. Active components manufactured by the Company consist of silicon photodiodes and hybrid photodetectors. Passive components include lenses, prisms, filters, mirrors and other precision optical products that are used by the Company in the manufacture of its optoelectronic products or are sold to others for use in telescopes, laser printers, copiers, microscopes and other detection and vision equipment. The devices manufactured by the Company are both standard products and products customized for specific applications. Most of the devices manufactured are incorporated into the subsystems manufactured by the Company. 
 
In addition to the manufacture of standard and OEM products, the Company also specializes in designing and manufacturing customized optoelectronic subsystems for use in a wide range of products and equipment. An optoelectronic subsystem typically consists of one or more optoelectronic devices that are combined with other electronic components and packaging for use in an end product. The composition of a subsystem can range from a simple assembly of various optoelectronic devices that are incorporated into other subsystems (for example, a printed circuit board containing the Company’s optoelectronic devices) to complete end-products (for example, medical pulse oximeter probes that are manufactured and packaged by the Company on behalf of the OEM customer and then shipped directly to the customer or the customer’s distributors). Since the end of fiscal 1996, the Company has manufactured subsystems for a variety of applications, including the following: fiber optics, imaging electronics for medical CT scanners, disposable and reusable medical probes for use with medical pulse oximetry equipment, components and subsystems for laser gyroscopes used in military and commercial aviation, optoelectronic subsystems for slot machines, laser subsystems in military helicopter gun sighting equipment, positioning subassemblies for computer peripheral equipment, alignment subsystems for laser heads in optical disc drives, and detection subsystems for submarines. 
 
The Company also manufactures high-speed silicon based photodetectors and detector-amplifier hybrids serving the fiber-optics and telecommunications market for LAN, 1.25 Gbps and 2.5 Gbps applications. In addition to silicon photodetectors, the Company manufactures indium gallium arsenide photodetectors for use in a wide variety of storage, local, metropolitan and wide area networks (LAN, MAN, WAN) and in long haul telecommunications. 
 
Through majority-owned subsidiary Dolphin Medical, Inc., the Company has also expanded into the field of manufacturing and selling digital medical monitoring systems. In this field, the Company offers families of pulse oximetry sensors to end users based on analog and digital signal processing technology. 
 
The Company has also moved into the field of manufacturing and selling the DTX 200 (DEXACARE) a U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved forearm DEXA (Dual Energy X-Ray) densitometer, which is used in the diagnosis of osteoporosis as well as to provide detection of early-age indications of the potential for later development of osteoporosis, and follow-up bone density measurements. The Company also produces the ultrasound DTU-One, the first commercially available scanner using imaging capability for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. In September 2000, the Company received pre-market approval (“PMA”) from the FDA to sell the DTU-One in the United States. The Company also received 510(K) approval from the FDA to sell its new dual energy x-ray based technology tabletop bone densitometer, the DexaCareG4. 
 
Markets, Customers and Applications 
 
Security and Inspection Products.    Since entering the security and inspection products market in 1993, the Company has shipped approximately 7,000 systems to approximately 50 countries. The following is a list of certain customers and/or installations that have purchased the Company’s security and inspection products since January 1993:

The market for most security and inspection products developed in response to civilian airline hijackings. Consequently, a significant portion of the Company’s security and inspection products were sold and continue to be sold for use at airports. Recently, however, the Company’s security and inspection products have been used for security purposes at locations in addition to airports, such as courthouses, office buildings, mail rooms, schools, prisons and high-profile locations such as Buckingham Palace, the Kremlin and the Vatican. In addition, the Company’s security and inspection products are increasingly being used for non-security purposes, such as for cargo inspection to detect narcotics and contraband and to verify manifests, prevention of pilferage at semiconductor manufacturing facilities, quality assurance for agricultural products, and the detection of gold and currency, and other customs inspection applications. The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon using hijacked airliners likely will continue to cause increasing levels of airport security measures, which have resulted in an increase in sales of the Company’s security and inspection products. 
 
In September 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration for advanced contraband detection systems with TIP features. The systems began to ship to Category X airports (designated due to their high security priority) in the United States during fiscal 1999. Systems were shipped during fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, and will continue to be shipped during fiscal 2003. In addition, the FAA ordered Rapiscan training computers to assist in the instruction of advanced detection technologies to security personnel. 
 
In January 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with the People’s Republic of China to upgrade and provide technical support for the Vehicle Cargo X-ray System (“VCXS”) operated by the Chinese customs authority at Shenzhen, near Hong Kong. The VCXS system allows a fast, detailed inspection of fully loaded trucks and 20-foot and 40-foot containers in lieu of a full manual search. 
 
In March 1999, the Company was awarded a contract by BAA plc, the operator of 11 airports around the world, including London’s Heathrow Airport, the busiest international airport in the world. Rapiscan U.K. has supplied, installed and will continue to maintain approximately 150 x-ray systems used in screening cabin baggage for explosives, weapons and other contraband in the U.K. and Scotland. These systems feature advanced detection software, including TIP. The agreement also provides for Rapiscan U.K. to provide maintenance and support services on the installed systems for five years. 
 
In April 2000, the Company was awarded a contract by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) to provide x-ray screening systems at selected airports throughout the United States. Under the contract, the FAA has the right to purchase up to 800 systems, for which the purchase price would be approximately $40 million. In fiscal years 2001 and 2002, the Company filled two orders for more than 300 systems under this contract. The Company holds an additional order for more than 100 systems, some of which were shipped in fiscal 2002 and the balance will be shipped in fiscal 2003. 
 
In June 2000, the Company was awarded a contract to supply two Rapiscan 2000 Series Large Cargo X-ray Systems to the government of Hong Kong. The aggregate price of these systems as of June 30, 2002 was approximately $9.7 million, an increase of $700,000 over the original project price, due to optional system upgrades. Through June 30, 2002, the Company has recognized $5.5 million of revenues from this project, based on progress to that date.

In August 2000, the Company formed OSI Fibercomm, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, to advance the Company’s fiber optic business. Fibercomm has undertaken the sales and marketing of the Company’s Indium Gallium Arsenide and silicon photodetectors and other fiber optic products developed by the Company’s subsidiary UDT Sensors, Inc. 
 
In fiscal 2001, the Company received orders totaling $13.4 million for components for the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement Systems (“MILES”), a weapons simulation system used for training purposes on the U.S. Army’s Apache Helicopter. 
 
Marketing, Sales and Service 
 
The Company markets and sells its security and inspection products worldwide through a direct sales and marketing staff of approximately 45 employees located in the United States, Finland, Canada, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Malaysia in addition to network of independent sales representatives. The Company markets and sells its optoelectronic devices and subsystems, and medical imaging and monitoring systems, worldwide through both a direct sales and marketing staff of approximately 30 employees and indirectly through a network of approximately 55 independent sales representatives and distributors. Most of the in-house sales staff is based in the United States while most of the independent sales representatives and distributors are located abroad. 
 
The Company’s optoelectronic products and medical imaging and monitoring systems sales staff, located in the United States, Singapore, Malaysia and Norway, is supported by an applications engineering group whose members are available to provide technical support. This support includes designing applications, providing custom tooling and process integration, defining solutions for customers and developing products that meet customer defined specifications. The security and inspection and medical imaging products sales staff is supported by a service organization of approximately 55 persons located primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, Finland and Malaysia. The Company also supports these sales and customer relations efforts by providing operator training, computerized training and testing equipment, in-country service, software upgrades, service training for customer technicians and a newsletter on security issues. 
 
The Company considers its maintenance service operations to be an important element of its business. After the expiration of the standard product warranty period, the Company is sometimes engaged by its customers to provide maintenance services for its security and inspection products through annual maintenance contracts. The Company believes that its international maintenance service capabilities allow it to be competitive in selling its security and inspection products. Furthermore, the Company believes that as its installed base of security and inspection products increases, revenues generated from such annual maintenance service contracts and from the sale of replacement parts will increase. 
 
Research and Development 
 
The Company’s security and inspection products are designed at the Company’s facilities in Hawthorne and Walnut, California; Crawley, England; Espoo, Finland; and Johar Bahru, Malaysia. These products include mechanical, electrical, electronic, digital electronic and software subsystems, which are all designed by

Table of Contents
the Company. In addition to product design, the Company provides system integration services to integrate its products into turnkey systems at the customer site. The Company supports cooperative research projects with government agencies and, on occasion, provides contract research for its customers and government agencies. 
 
The Company’s components and optoelectronic subsystems are designed and engineered at the Company’s facilities in Hawthorne, California, and Horten, Norway. The subsystems that the Company manufactures are engineered by the Company to solve specific application needs of its OEM customers. The Company’s customers typically request that the Company design custom optoelectronic solutions for their specific needs when standard components or subsystems are not available from other manufacturers of optoelectronic devices. After an end-product has been conceptualized by the OEM, the Company normally will involve its engineers to design the application, establish the mechanical specifications for the application, create the appropriate subsystem architecture for the application, and design the development, production and assembly process for the manufacture of the ultimate subsystem. However, because the Company has the engineering, tooling and manufacturing capabilities to design and manufacture entire subsystems, and not just a specific component, the Company typically also designs, manufactures and assembles the entire subsystem for the customer. Because the Company’s engineers are able to provide additional value and services to its customers through the entire production process from concept to completion, the Company considers its engineering personnel to be an important extension of its core sales and marketing effort. 
 
In addition to close collaboration with the Company’s customers in the design and development of optoelectronics-based products, the Company maintains an active program for the development and introduction of new products and enhancements and improvements to its existing products, including the implementation of new applications of its technology. The Company seeks to further develop its research and development program and considers such a program to be an important element of its business and operations. As of June 30, 2002, in addition to the engineers that the Company employed in manufacturing, process design and applications development, the Company engaged approximately 90 full-time engineers, technicians and support staff in research and development. During fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, the Company’s research and development expenses were approximately $7.7 million, $6.7 million and $6.4 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to certain research and development personnel working on specific shipments and the cost of their services was charged to manufacturing overhead and was also offset in part by increased research and development spending on security and inspection products. In order to fulfill its strategy of increasing its security and inspection product lines and of enhancing the capabilities of its existing products, the Company intends to continue to increase its research and development efforts in the future. 
 
Manufacturing and Materials Management 
 
The Company currently has manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, Finland, Canada and Norway, in addition to its domestic manufacturing facilities in Hawthorne and Walnut, California and Ocean Springs, Mississippi. The Company’s principal manufacturing facility is in Hawthorne, California. However, most of the Company’s high volume, labor intensive manufacturing and assembly is generally performed at its facility in Malaysia. Since most of the Company’s customers currently are located in Europe and the United States, the Company’s ability to assemble its products in these markets and provide follow-on service from offices located in these regions is an important component of the Company’s global strategy. 
 
The Company seeks to focus its subsystem manufacturing resources on its core competencies that enable it to provide value-added enhancements and distinctive value. The Company believes that its manufacturing organization has expertise in optoelectronic, electrical and mechanical manufacturing and assembly of products for commercial applications and for high reliability applications. High reliability devices and subsystems are those which are designed, manufactured, screened and qualified to function under exceptionally severe levels of environmental stress. The manufacturing techniques include silicon wafer processing and fabrication, manufacture and assembly of photodiodes, surface mounting (SMT) and manual thru-hole assembly, thick-film ceramic processing, wire bonding, molding, assembly of components, testing, and packaging. The Company also has the ability to manufacture plastic parts and certain other parts that are either not available from third party suppliers or that can be more efficiently or cost-effectively manufactured in-house. The Company outsources certain manufacturing operations including its sheet metal fabrication. The manufacturing process for components and subsystems consists of manual tasks performed by skilled and semi-skilled workers as well as automated tasks. The number of subsystems that the Company manufacturers depend on the customers’ needs and may range from a few subsystems (such as an optoelectronic sun sensor for use in a satellite) to many thousands (sensors used in laser printers and bar code readers).

The principal raw materials and subcomponents used in producing the Company’s optoelectronic devices and subsystems consist of silicon wafers, ceramics, electronic subcomponents, light emitting diodes, phototransistors, printed circuit boards, headers and caps, housings, cables, filters and packaging materials. For cost, quality control and efficiency reasons, the Company generally purchases raw materials and subcomponents only from single vendors with whom the Company has ongoing relationships. The Company does, however, qualify second sources for most of its raw materials and subcomponents, or has identified alternate sources of supply. The Company purchases the materials pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The silicon-based optoelectronic devices manufactured by the Company are critical components in most of its subsystems. Since 1987, the Company has purchased substantially all of the silicon wafers it uses to manufacture its optoelectronic devices from Wacker Siltronic Corp. Although to date the Company has not experienced any significant shortages or material delays in obtaining any of its raw materials or subcomponents, there can be no assurance that the Company will not face such shortages or delays in one or more of these materials in the future. 
 
Substantially all of the optoelectronic devices, subsystems, circuit boards and x-ray generators used in the Company’s inspection and detection systems are manufactured in-house. The metal shells of the x-ray inspection systems, and certain standard mechanical parts are purchased from various third-party unaffiliated providers.

The Company believes that the above patents and trademarks are important to the Company’s business. The loss of some of these patents or trademarks might have a negative impact; however, the Company operates in a competitive environment with a known customer base and relies mainly on providing value for money with quality products and services to ensure continuing business. 
 
Environmental Regulations 
 
The Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, and disposal of certain hazardous substances and wastes used or generated in the manufacturing and assembly of the Company’s products. Under such laws, the Company may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances that have been or are being released on or in its facilities or that have been or are being disposed of off site as waste. Such laws may impose liability without regard to whether the Company knew of, or caused, the release of such hazardous substances. In the past, the Company has conducted a Phase I environmental assessment report for each of the properties in the United States at which it manufactures products. The purpose of each such report was to identify, as of the date of that report, potential sources of contamination of the property. In certain cases, the Company has received a Phase II environmental assessment report consisting of further soil testing and other investigations deemed appropriate by an independent environmental consultant. The Company believes that it is currently in compliance with all material environmental regulations in connection with its manufacturing operations, and that it has obtained all material environmental permits necessary to conduct its business. The amount of hazardous substances and wastes produced and generated by the Company may increase in the future depending on changes in the Company’s operations. Any failure by the Company to comply with present or future regulations could subject the Company to the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing process or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Company discovered soil and groundwater contamination at its Hawthorne, California facility. It has filed the requisite reports concerning this problem with the appropriate environmental authorities in fiscal 2001. The Company has not yet received any response to such reports, and no agency action or litigation is presently pending or threatened. The Company also has notified the prior owners of the Company property and the present owners and tenants of adjacent properties concerning the problem and has requested from such parties agreements to toll of the statute of limitations with respect to actions against such parties with respect to the contamination in order that it may focus its attention on resolution of the contamination problem. The Company site has been used previously for semiconductor manufacturing similar to that presently conducted on the site by the Company, and it is not presently known who is responsible for the contamination and the remediation. The groundwater contamination is a known regional problem, not limited to the Company premises or its immediate surroundings. 
 
Competition 
 
The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive and characterized by evolving customer needs and rapid technological change. The Company competes with a number of other manufacturers, some of which have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than the Company. In addition, these competitors may have the ability to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements, have stronger customer relationships, have greater name recognition, and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than does the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against any current or future competitors in either the optoelectronic devices and subsystems and medical imaging and monitoring systems or the security and inspection markets or that future competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect its business, financial conditions and results of operations. 
 
In the security and inspection market, competition is based primarily on such factors as product performance, functionality and quality, the over-all cost effectiveness of the system, prior customer relationships, technological capabilities of the products, price, local market presence, and breadth of sales and service organization. The Company believes that its principal competitors in the market for security and inspection products are the Detection Systems division of L-3 Communications Corporation, Heimann Systems GmbH, American Science and Engineering, Inc., SAIC, Control Screening L.L.C., CEIA, SpA, Garrett Electronics, Inc. Competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins, and loss of market share by the Company. In the airline and airport security and inspection market, particularly in the upgrade and replacement market, the Company also competes for potential customers based on existing relationships between its competitors and the customers. Certain of the Company’s competitors have been manufacturing inspection systems since the 1980s and have established strong relationships with airlines and airport authorities. The Company believes that the image quality and resolution of certain of its security and inspection products is superior to the image quality offered by most of its competitors’ x-ray based inspection products. Additionally, the Company’s true multi-zone metal detection technology provides the ability to detect small metallic objects and offer higher levels of discrimination in weapons-screening applications. Although the Company also has established relationships with a number of airport and airline customers, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully compete in the future with existing competitors or with new entrants. 
 
In the optoelectronic devices and subsystems market, competition for optoelectronic devices and subsystems is based primarily on such factors as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices, product quality, timeliness of delivery, price, customer technical support, and on the ability to provide fully integrated services from application development and design through volume subsystem production. The Company believes that its major competitors in the optoelectronic device and subsystem market are PerkinElmer, Inc.’s Electro-Optics division, Hamamatsu Corporation, and Honeywell Optoelectronics, a division of Honeywell, Inc. Because the Company specializes in custom subsystems requiring a high degree of engineering expertise, the Company believes that it generally does not compete to any significant degree with any other large United States, European or Asian manufacturers of standard optoelectronic components. Competition for the Company’s medical imaging products comes principally from Lunar Corporation, Hologic, Inc. and Norland Medical Systems, Inc. 
 
As the fiber optics market is fairly atomized, the Company has many competitors in the market, both domestic and foreign.

Backlog 
 
The Company measures its backlog as orders for which purchase orders or contracts have been signed, but which have not yet been shipped and for which revenues have not yet been recognized. The Company typically ships its optoelectronic devices and subsystems, and medical imaging and monitoring systems as well as its security and inspection products within one to several months after receiving an order. However, such shipments may be delayed for a variety of reasons including any special design or engineering requirements of the customer. In addition, large orders (more than ten machines) of security and inspection products typically require more lead-time. 
 
Large cargo scanning machines may require several months to several years lead-time. The only significant shipping delays the Company has experienced are with large cargo scanners. Such delays can occur for any of the following reasons, among others: (i) additional time necessary to conduct large cargo system inspections at the factory before shipment; (ii) the customer’s needs to engage in timely special site preparation to accommodate such a scanner, as to which the Company has no control or responsibility; (iii) additional fine tuning of such scanners once they are installed; (iv) design or specification changes by the customer; and (v) delays originating from other contractors on the project. 
 
At June 30, 2002, the Company’s backlog products totaled approximately $89.6 million, compared to approximately $53.2 million at June 30, 2001 and approximately $54.3 million at June 30, 2000. The backlog at June 30, 2000 included a backlog of SMI of approximately $4.5 million, whereas the June 30, 2001 and 2002 backlogs do not include any SMI backlog because the Company has sold SMI. The backlog as of June 30, 2002 and 2001 includes approximately $5.0 million and $6.0 million respectively of OSI Fibercomm backlog, delivery of most of which is presently on hold and being rescheduled with customers, and the Company does not presently know when it may be shipped. Most of the Company’s backlog as of June 30, 2002, is expected to be shipped during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003. Sales orders underlying the Company’s backlog are firm orders. Any failure of the Company to meet an agreed upon schedule could lead to the cancellation of the related order. Moreover from time to time the Company may agree to permit the cancellation of an order on a negotiated basis. Variations in the size of the order, the product mix, and delivery requirements of the customer order may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period. Backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of the Company’s revenues for any future period and cannot be considered a meaningful indicator of the Company’s performance on an annual or quarterly basis.
