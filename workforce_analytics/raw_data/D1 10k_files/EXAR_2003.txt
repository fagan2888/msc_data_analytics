Industry Background 

 

Communications technology has evolved from simple analog voice signals transmitted over networks of copper telephone lines to complex analog and digital voice and data signals transmitted over hybrid networks of media, such as copper, coaxial and fiber optic cables. This evolution has been driven by large increases in the number of users and the complexity and variety of the data transmitted over networks resulting from: 

 

  •   the substantial growth in the Internet and its transformation from a text-based medium to a multimedia platform containing images, video and sound;  

 

  •   the growth of wireless communications; and  

 

  •   the increased demand for remote network access and higher-speed, higher-bandwidth communication between LANs, MANs and WANs.  

 

The majority of installed communications systems were designed to transmit only voice communications, and, therefore, are inadequate for the high-bandwidth transmission of both voice and data. Access to the public network is typically based on asynchronous technologies, such as T/E carrier over copper wire. The demand for

greater bandwidth is driving a migration from lower-speed T1/E1, to higher-speed T3/E3 transmission rates. The T1/E1 standard permits the transmission of data at 1.5 Mbps/2.0 Mbps, and the T3/E3 standard permits the transmission of data at 45 Mbps/34 Mbps. The backbone of the public network is built on an optical fiber transmission medium that employs synchronous technologies such as SONET/SDH. Similar to the utilization of faster transmission rates over copper wire, SONET/SDH protocols such as OC–3 (1.554 Mbps) are being upgraded to OC-12 (622 Mbps) and OC-48 (2.5 Gbps) to increase the bandwidth over a single optical fiber. 

 

The market dynamics of the communications industry have changed significantly since 2000. Many carriers that spent billions of dollars building out their networks in 2000 and prior years were not successful in executing their business models, and consequently, were sold or declared bankruptcy. Incumbent telephone companies (such as AT&T Corp., Sprint Corporation and MCI WORLDCOM, Inc.) and regional bell operating companies (such as BellSouth Corporation, Verizon Communications Inc. and SBC Communications Inc.) have substantially reduced their capital expenditures in line with current revenues. This dynamic has severely impacted Exar’s customers, communications equipment OEMs, or original equipment manufacturers, many of which have undergone or are undergoing extensive restructuring to eliminate excess inventory and to reduce expenses by significantly downsizing their organizations. At the same time, the Company’s OEM customers are and will continue to come under tremendous pressure to develop new products for access and MAN markets that will enable carriers to leverage their current network infrastructure. 

 

To address these evolving requirements of the communications industry, OEMs must develop and introduce increasingly sophisticated systems with fewer engineering resources. To achieve the performance and functionality required of these systems, communications OEMs are using increasingly complex communications ICs, which now account for a significant portion of the value-added proprietary content of these systems. As a result of the need for new equipment introductions, coupled with the reduction in their technical staff, the proliferation of transmission standards and the difficulty of designing and producing communications ICs, equipment suppliers are increasingly outsourcing the design and production of the ICs incorporated into their systems. 

 

The key ICs contained in a typical communications system include physical-interface, access control, network processor, traffic manager and switch fabric devices. The physical-interface device consists of a transmitter and receiver that, when integrated, is called a transceiver. Transceivers interface with the physical transmission media, such as copper wire or optical fiber. Most of these high-speed, mixed-signal ICs convert parallel digital signals into a single analog bit stream that is up to 32 times faster than the original signal. Transceivers therefore serve as a bridge between analog transmission media and the digital devices that process data. Access control circuits are digital ICs that format, or frame, the data, perform error checking and in some applications aggregate signals by mapping multiple lower-speed data streams to a single higher-speed stream. The traffic manager manages the transfer of data between the network processor and the switch fabric, which work together to shape, route and control the data. 

 

Because physical-interface and access control ICs interface with the transmission media and are critical to increasing bandwidth, these ICs must offer high-speed and robust performance. Therefore, communications equipment OEMs seek IC suppliers that possess extensive analog and digital expertise to provide high-speed, mixed-signal solutions to bridge the analog physical world and the digital computing environment. This must be coupled with system-level expertise so that a supplier can quickly bring to market high-performance, highly reliable ICs with optimal feature sets.

Manufacturing 

 

Exar out-sources all of its fabrication and assembly, as well as the majority of its testing operations. This fabless manufacturing model allows the Company to focus on its core competencies of product design and development. 

 

The majority of the Company’s current products are implemented in standard CMOS. The Company uses CMOS manufacturing processes to take advantage of that technology’s lower power consumption, cost-effectiveness, foundry availability and ever-increasing speed. Currently, all of the Company’s new product development is being implemented in CMOS. Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing (“Chartered”) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, (“TSMC”) manufacture all of the Company’s CMOS products. In addition, Chartered manufactures all of the Company’s BiCMOS products, which combine bipolar and CMOS processes. The Company does not have long term supply agreements with Chartered or TSMC. Chartered has announced that it intends to transfer production from its foundry which utilizes six-inch wafer manufacturing technologies to a facility that is based on eight-inch wafer manufacturing technologies. Chartered has indicated that it intends to close the older foundry concurrently with the transfer of manufacturing operations to the newer facility by March 2004. The transfer of many of the Company’s existing products to the new foundry entails certain risks and uncertainties. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Risk Factors.” 

 

Most semiconductor wafers are usually shipped to the Company’s subcontractors in Asia for wafer test and assembly, where they are cut into individual die and packaged. Independent contractors in Hong Kong, Indonesia and Singapore perform most of the Company’s assembly work. Following assembly, final test and quality assurance are performed either at the Company’s Fremont, California facility or at its subcontractors’ facilities in Asia. The combination of various functions makes the test process for analog and mixed-signal devices particularly difficult. Test operations require the programming, maintenance and use of sophisticated computer-based test systems and complex automatic handling systems. 

 

Research and Development 

 

Exar believes that the continued introduction of new products in its target markets is essential to its growth. Exar’s research and development is focused on developing high-performance analog, digital and mixed-signal solutions addressing the high-bandwidth requirements of communications systems OEMs. Exar has made significant investments in advanced design tools and high-performance standard cell libraries. By utilizing these tools, the Company has developed design methodologies that are optimized for reducing design-cycle time and increasing chances of first-time success. In order to support high pin-count devices, the Company continues to

Table of Contents
develop high-performance packages for its new products in collaboration with packaging suppliers. As of March 31, 2003, the Company’s research and development staff consisted of 137 employees, 53 of whom hold advanced degrees. 

 

Competition 

 

The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and a history of price reductions as production efficiencies are achieved in successive generations of products. Although the market for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits is generally characterized by longer product life cycles and less dramatic price reductions than the market for digital integrated circuits, the Company faces substantial competition in each market in which it participates. Competition in the Company’s markets is based principally on technical innovation, product features, timely introduction of new products, quality and reliability, performance, price, technical support and service. The Company believes that it competes favorably in all of these areas. 

 

Because the IC markets are highly fragmented, the Company generally encounters different competitors in its various market areas. Competitors with respect to the Company’s communications products include Applied Micro Circuits Corporation, Mindspeed Technologies, a division of Conexant Systems, Inc., PMC-Sierra, Inc., and TranSwitch Corporation. Competitors in the Company’s serial communications and video and imaging markets include Analog Devices Inc., Philips Electronics, Texas Instruments Incorporated and Wolfson Microelectronics LTD. 

 

Backlog 

 

Exar defines backlog to include OEM orders and distributor orders for which a delivery schedule has been specified for product shipment occurring primarily during the succeeding six months. 

 

At March 31, 2003, Exar’s backlog was $9.4 million, compared to $15.1 million at March 31, 2002. Exar believes that the decrease in the Company’s backlog was due to a reduction in carrier capital expenditures by the Company’s communications customers. Additionally, the decrease in backlog resulted from the shortened order-to-shipment time for the Company’s products. Over the past 18 to 24 months, the Company has experienced an increased percentage of orders received that shipped in the same quarter. If this practice of short order-to-delivery times continues, the Company’s backlog may be less than in previous years and a less reliable indicator of future revenue. 

 

Sales are made pursuant to either purchase orders for current delivery of standard items or agreements covering purchases over a period of time, which are frequently subject to revision and cancellation. Lead times for the release of purchase orders depend on the scheduling practices of the individual customer, and the Company’s rate of bookings varies from month-to-month. In addition, Exar’s domestic distributor agreements generally permit the return of up to 10% of purchases of the preceding quarter for purposes of stock rotation and also provide for credits to distributors in the event that Exar reduces the price of any product. Because of the possibility of changes in delivery schedules, quantities actually purchased, cancellations of orders, distributor returns or price reductions, Exar’s backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual sales for any succeeding six-month period. Customers can cancel a significant portion, if not all, of their backlog at their discretion without substantial penalty. 

 

Intellectual Property Rights 

 

The Company has 108 patents issued and 29 patent applications pending in the U.S. The Company has 12 patents issued and 33 patent applications pending in various foreign countries. None of the Company’s key domestic and foreign patents that have been issued will expire in the near future unless the Company chooses not to pay renewal fees.

The Company may fail to adequately protect its intellectual property. Others may gain access to the Company’s trade secrets or disclose such trade secrets to third parties. Some or all of the Company’s pending and future patent applications may not result in issued patents that provide it with a competitive advantage. Even if issued, such patents, as well as its existing patents, may be challenged and later determined to be invalid or unenforceable. In addition, others may develop similar or superior products without access to or without infringing upon its intellectual property, including intellectual property that is protected by trade secret and patent rights. 

 

The Company cannot be sure that its products or technologies do not infringe patents that may be granted in the future pursuant to pending patent applications or that the Company’s products do not infringe any patents or proprietary rights of third parties. Occasionally, the Company is informed by third parties of alleged patent infringement. In the event that any relevant claims of third-party patents are found to be valid and enforceable, the Company may be required to: 

 

  •   stop selling, incorporating or using its products that use the infringed intellectual property;  

 

  •   obtain a license to make, sell or use the relevant technology from the owner of the infringed intellectual property, although, such license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; and  

 

  •   redesign the Company’s products so as not to use the fringed intellectual property, which may not be technically or commercially feasible.  

 

If the Company were required to take any of the actions described above or defend against any claims from third parties, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.
