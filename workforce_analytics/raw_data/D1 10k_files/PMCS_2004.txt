INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

 

Worldwide demand for Internet connectivity and the volume of information transmitted over the Internet have both grown steadily over the last few years.  As data traffic increases, communication service providers seek to increase their revenues by delivering a growing range of data services to their customers in a cost-effective manner.  To provide advanced voice, data, and video services, service providers must transition their voice-centric infrastructure to data-centric networks.   Other commercial enterprises are also expanding their data networks to compete cost-effectively in a world where more and more daily business operations require Internet connectivity and the ability to move, store and manage large quantities of data.  Different types of data transmitted at different speeds over the Internet require service providers and enterprises to invest in multi-service equipment that efficiently handles, processes and transports many different types of traffic.

 

The Internet’s structure drives the need for equipment that handles multiple types of data traffic. Internet traffic moves over a hybrid series of distinct networks, with each network built using copper wires, coaxial cables or fiber optic cables.  These networks carry high-speed traffic in the form of electrical and optical signals that are transmitted and received by complex networking equipment.  To ensure this equipment and the various networks can easily communicate with each other, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and makers of communications semiconductors have developed numerous communications standards and protocols for the industry.  These communications protocols make it easier for complex high-speed data traffic to be sent and received reliably and efficiently — whether intra-office, across the country, or internationally.

 

One industry standard that packages information into a fixed-size cell format for transportation across networks is ATM, or Asynchronous Transfer Mode. Many service providers deploy equipment that handles this protocol because it can support voice, video, data, and multimedia applications simultaneously.

 

The Internet Protocol, called IP, is another transport protocol that maintains network information and routes packets across networks.  IP packets are larger and can hold more data than ATM cells, but, service providers may have difficulty providing the same quality of service with IP

 

3


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

because it is not optimized for time-sensitive signals such as video and voice.  Despite this limitation of IP traffic, there is an emerging trend toward use of Voice Over IP (VoIP) as networks become more data-centric.

 

High capacity data communication over fiber optic systems uses a standard called SONET (for Synchronous Optical Network) in the Americas and parts of Asia, and called SDH (for Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) in the rest of the world. In addition to using SONET to increase the bandwidth, or capacity, of their networks, many service providers have also deployed equipment that uses an optical technology called dense wave division multiplexing.  Rather than transmitting a single light signal over an optical fiber, dense wave division multiplexing allows many different light signals (each of a different wavelength) to be transmitted simultaneously.  By deploying this technique at higher transmission rates, carriers can move more signals across transmission lines.

 

Ethernet is a protocol historically used within an enterprise’s local area networks, or LANs, that is now also used in wide area networks, or WANs.  Service providers are beginning to transport Ethernet traffic over their existing SONET infrastructure, because service providers are familiar with SONET, which provides a relatively efficient way to handle increasing amounts of data moving from the LAN to the WAN.

 

Digital Subscriber Loop, or DSL, is an access technology that allows for high-speed data communication over existing copper telephone lines between end-users and telephone companies. DSL uses a complex digital signal processing technique to achieve typical downstream data speeds of 1.5 megabits per second and typical upstream speeds of 128 kilobits per second. DSL is largely intended for residential and small business customers who desire higher speed access to Internet services.

 

Service providers not only need to transport large amounts of data at high speeds using different protocols and technologies, but they are also experiencing traffic bottlenecks where high-speed long-haul traffic is handed off to networking equipment in a city center or region, called the metro area.  Enterprises with their own communication networks, particularly those which have integrated high speed data storage systems into their businesses, experience similar bottlenecks.  In response, many OEMs are designing faster and more highly integrated equipment to handle higher data volumes, which must also accommodate multiple communication protocols.

 

OEMs must meet this demand for next-generation equipment despite reductions in their development teams that previously designed custom semiconductor solutions for each OEM. Insufficient internal technical resources, coupled with increasing development costs for custom semiconductors, has resulted in more OEMs outsourcing their communications integrated circuit design, and accelerating their demand for standard semiconductor solutions which operate at high speeds and comply with multiple protocols.

 

PRODUCTS

 

PMC-Sierra designs, develops, markets and supports a broad range of high-performance integrated circuits, which process analog and digital signals in a wide range of speeds and comply with multiple protocols, used in the telecommunications and data networking industries.

 

4


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

We have more than 180 revenue-producing products in our portfolio.  Many of our products are designed with standardized interfaces between chips so our customers can easily develop and implement solutions involving multiple PMC-Sierra products.

 

We sell our networking products primarily into four areas of the worldwide network infrastructure, which we call the Access, Metro, Enterprise/Storage, and Consumer-related markets. The following describes PMC-Sierra’s view of these markets and some typical equipment that may include our chips and chipsets.  Due to the complexity of the telecommunications network, it is not possible to sharply delineate networking functions or markets served. In addition, many of our products may be used in multiple classes of networking equipment that are deployed across all of the market areas identified below, while some of our other products have highly specialized applications.  For example, our microprocessors can be used in many networking equipment applications (such as high-speed routers or networked printers), while our Paladin chip may only be used in a single application  (power amplification for wireless base stations).  In some situations, different OEMs might use our chips or chipsets in equipment addressing more than one of the market areas noted below.  Further, during the lifecycle of their products, our customers from time to time may redesign their products and exclude our products from the new design.  We are not always aware when customers undertake such actions.

 

While our current product development efforts are focused on each of the following network infrastructure areas, we derive less than 10% of our current revenues from the storage and consumer markets.  One of our key strategies is expand our business in these markets.

 

•                  Access:  this area of the telecommunications network infrastructure encompasses wired and wireless equipment that aggregates transmissions from the home or office and connects that traffic to the metro and the wide area network (WAN). For example, our semiconductors would be used in equipment such as add-drop multiplexers  (which add and drop signals and streams of data from optical networks) and switches (which direct the data traffic to other destinations within the network).  The Access area of the network involves not only aggregation equipment but also termination equipment, which separates trunk data signals into lower speed, tributary data signals.  Many of our networking devices used in wireline communications infrastructure are also deployed in the uplink of wireless data traffic to the network.

 

•                  Metro: the metropolitan area of the internet infrastructure is predominantly a fiber optic-based network that provides high-speed communications and data transfer over a city center or regional area.  This portion of the network manages traffic inside its own region and manages traffic between the access and long-haul transport networks for inter-city or international transmission.  Our products are used in metro equipment such as multi-service switches and routers that gather and process signals in different protocols, and then transmit them to the next destination as quickly and efficiently as possible.  The next-generation equipment in the metro portion of the network that can handle different data protocols is often referred to as multi-service provisioning platforms (MSPPs).

 

5


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

•                  Enterprise/Storage: this area of the network includes equipment that is deployed primarily in the office for data communications and other local area network applications.  Our products are used in equipment such as laser printers for the office, as well as switches and storage devices that enable data to be transferred to local telecommunications networks. It also includes storage area networks and storage systems equipment that manage, transmit and store large quantities of data utilized by enterprises, corporations and government agencies.

 

•                  Consumer:  While not generally considered part of the network infrastructure, the consumer area includes equipment, used primarily by individuals in their homes for entertainment and communications purposes that require interfaces with the telecommunications network. For example, some of our lower-end microprocessors are used in equipment such as set-top boxes, high-definition TVs, and personal video recorders.

 

Our chips and chipsets can also be divided into the broadly defined functional categories identified below. As with descriptions of the network, particular categories may overlap and a device may be present in more than one category. In addition, some products, particularly multiple chip sets, integrate different functions and could be classified in one or more categories. For example, some of our products convert high-speed analog signals to digital signals and split or combine various transmission signals.

 

•                  Line interface units: these devices, also referred to as transceivers, transmit and receive signals over a physical medium such as wire, cable or fiber.  The line interface unit determines the speed and timing characteristics of the signals, and may also convert them from a serial stream of data into a parallel stream before they are further processed for transmission to the next destination.

 

•                  Framers and mappers: before the data can be sent to the next destination, it must be converted into a proper format for transmission in the network.  For example, the framing function arranges the bits into different size formats, commonly referred to as “cell” or “packet” formats, and attaches the appropriate information to the formats to ensure they reach their destinations.  In turn, this data may be inserted into other frames, such as SONET frames, for transmission across high-speed fiber optics.

 

•                  Packet and cell processors:  these devices examine the contents of cells, or packets, and perform various management and reporting functions.  For instance, a switch or router may use a packet or cell processor to determine if a signal is voice or video in order to allocate the proper amount of bandwidth.

 

•                  Traffic managers and switch fabrics:  traffic managers organize, schedule and queue cells and packets into and out of switches.  Switch fabrics interconnect the wires and fibers, allowing the data to be routed to its intended destination.

 

•                  Microprocessors: these devices perform the high-speed computations that help identify and control the flow of signals and data in many different types of network equipment used in the communications, enterprise and consumer markets.

 

6


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

•                  Serializers/Deserializers:  these devices convert networking traffic between slower speed parallel streams and higher speed serial streams.  OEMs use serial streams to reduce networking equipment line connections, and parallel streams to allow them to apply lower cost traffic management technologies.

 

STRATEGY

 

Our high-speed semiconductor solutions are based on our strong knowledge of network applications, system requirements and networking protocols. To achieve our goal of profitably expanding our business, we are pursuing the following key strategies:

 

Continue to increase our presence in Asian markets

 

Over the past decade, we have been developing strong relationships with our Asian customers. In 2003, close to 40% of our total revenues were generated in the Asia Pacific region. Based on PMC’s 2003 revenues, some of our largest customers in Japan and Korea include Fujitsu, NEC, Ricoh and Samsung.  In addition, we continue to work with OEMs in the People’s Republic of China, including Fiberhome Telecommunication Technologies, Huawei Technologies and ZTE.  Our customers in Asia are broadening their product offerings in Access, Metro and Wireless Infrastructure equipment to meet the growing needs of their domestic markets as well as emerging international markets. We are continuing to increase the number of sales/marketing personnel serving the Asia Pacific market and have added distribution capabilities in some of the regional markets.

 

Broaden our business into the Enterprise, Storage and Consumer markets

 

The majority of our products are used by OEMs that sell their networking equipment to telecommunications service providers worldwide. We are continuing to direct many of our existing products, and newly designed devices, into growing enterprise, storage and consumer markets.  For example, we introduced several new products in 2003 for OEMs selling equipment into the storage area networking market. Our lower-speed microprocessors are being designed into multi-function devices as well as into consumer applications such as personal video recorders, set-top boxes and high-definition TVs. We are working closely with some of the largest players in the enterprise and storage markets to help these customers design and develop standard semiconductor solutions that will meet their performance requirements and help lower their costs.

 

Leverage technical expertise across diverse base of applications

 

We have a strong history of analog, digital, mixed signal and microprocessor expertise and we are able to integrate many of these functions and protocols into our products. We leverage our common technologies and intellectual property across a broad range of networking equipment. Many OEMs recognize they can obtain highly complex, broadband communications technology from companies such as PMC-Sierra rather than dedicating their own resources to develop custom chips. We intend to take advantage of our customers’ growing requirements to outsource more of the silicon content in their networking equipment which will allow the OEMs to reduce their development costs and improve time-to-market while differentiating their

 

7


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

products in other ways.

 

Provide first-class products, customer service and technical support

 

We work very closely with our customers to ensure they get the best service and technical support required to assist them with their product development efforts. As the marketplace for telecommunications equipment suppliers consolidates, we believe our largest customers and their products will take an increasing percentage of the overall market in their areas of expertise. Customers such as Alcatel, Cisco, Fiberhome , Hewlett Packard,  Lexmark, Lucent, Nortel, Ricoh, Samsung and ZTE, are aligning their design and manufacturing operations with key suppliers like PMC-Sierra.

 

SALES, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

 

Our sales and marketing strategy is to have our products designed into our customers’ equipment by developing superior products for which we provide premium service and technical support. We maintain close working relationships with many of our customers. Our marketing team is focused on developing new products that meet the needs of our customers in our target markets. We are often involved in the early stages of design concerning our customers’ plans for new equipment. This helps us determine if our existing products can be used in their new equipment or if new devices need to be considered for the application. To assist us in our planning process, we are in regular contact with our largest customers to discuss industry trends, emerging standards and ways in which we can assist in their new product requirements.

 

To promote our products, our sales and marketing teams are actively involved in demonstrating our devices with other industry suppliers and providing technical information to our customers.  Technical support is essential to our customers’ success, and we provide this through field application engineers, technical marketing and factory systems engineers.  We also provide more detailed information and support for our product line through our corporate website and special customer-accessible extranet sites. We believe that providing comprehensive product service and support is critical to shortening customers’ design cycles and maintaining a competitive position in the networking market.

 

Our sales team is organized into two groups to better meet our customer’s different requirements.  One group is focused on selling and supporting our products for communications equipment providers to service provider companies. The second sales group provides sales and product support to companies focused on equipment for the storage, enterprise or consumer customers.  To better match our available sales resources to market opportunities, we also focus our sales and support efforts on target customers.

 

We sell our products both directly and through distributors and independent manufacturers’ representatives. In 2003, approximately 36% of our orders were shipped through our distributors, approximately 50% were sent by us directly to contract manufacturers selected by OEMs, and the balance of 14% were sent directly to our OEM customers.

 

Our largest distributor is Memec Group Holdings Ltd., which represents our products worldwide (excluding Japan, Israel, and Taiwan).  We distinguish this distributor as our major distributor given the magnitude of sales we generate from this company and the North American portion of sales

 

8


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

recognized through this distributor are on a sell-through basis, or once Memec ships our products to an end customer.  In 2003, total sales shipped through the Memec Group were $53.4 million, or 21% of total revenues (2002 - 24%, 2001 - 33%).  Our second largest distributor is Macnica.  Sales shipped through this distributor in 2003 were 11% of total revenues and less than 10% of total revenues in 2002 and 2001.  Many of our customers are seeking to reduce supply chain costs and are requesting that we ship more of our products directly to the contract manufacturers they have selected.

 

Our sales outside of the United States, based on customer billing location, accounted for 52% of total revenue in 2003, 45% in 2002, and 42% in 2001. Our sales to Asia, including China, continued to increase in 2003 (38% of sales) from 2002 (27% of sales), as more of our OEM customers use Asia based contract manufacturers for the assembly of their products.

 

Cisco Systems and Hewlett-Packard each represented more than 10% of our 2003 revenues based on total sales to end customers through distributors, contract manufacturers or direct sales.

 

MANUFACTURING

 

We are a fabless company, meaning we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our products are made.  Instead, we use independent foundries and chip assemblers for the manufacture of our products.  We believe our fabless approach to manufacturing provides us with the benefit of superior manufacturing capability, as well as flexibility to move wafer manufacture, assembly and test of our products to the vendors that offer the best technology and service, at an attractive price.

 

Typically, the complete manufacture of our chips requires 12 to 16 weeks, which we refer to as our lead-time. Based on this lead-time, our team of production planners will initiate purchase orders with our suppliers for wafers and for the assembly and test of our parts so that our products are available at a mutually agreed upon delivery time.

 

Wafer Fabrication

 

We manufacture our products using standard CMOS process techniques.  We receive substantially all of the silicon wafers from which we derive our products from Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. (“Chartered”), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (“TSMC”), and IBM.  These independent foundries produce our networking products at feature sizes down to 0.13 micron.   By using independent foundries to fabricate our wafers, we are better able to concentrate our resources on designing, development and testing of new products.  In addition, we avoid much of the fixed capital and operating costs associated with owning and operating fabrication or chip assembly facilities.

 

We have supply agreements with both Chartered and TSMC that we renewed during 2003.  These renewed agreements are in effect until December 31, 2004.  As a result of these renewals, the deposits we have made to secure access to wafer fabrication capacity decreased to $6.8 million under both of these agreements, from $22 million at December 31, 2002.  Under these agreements, the foundries must supply certain quantities of wafers per year.  Neither of these agreements have minimum unit volume requirements but we are obliged under one of the

 

9


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

agreements to purchase a minimum percentage of our total annual wafer requirements provided that the foundry is able to continue to offer competitive technology, pricing, quality and delivery. The agreements may be terminated if either party does not comply with the terms.  We do not currently anticipate any problems in renewing these supply agreements beyond the current expiry dates.

 

Assembly and Test

 

Once the wafers are fabricated, they must be probed, or inspected, to distinguish usable from unusable chip parts, referred to as die, on the wafer.  Most wafers are sent directly to an outside assembly house where they are cut and the good die are in turn packaged into chips.  The chips are then run through various electrical and visual tests before delivery to the customer.  With most of our products, we have the option to probe the wafers or test the final chips in-house or subcontract the probing or testing to independent subcontractors.

 

Quality Assurance

 

The telecommunications and data networking industries require high quality and reliable semiconductors for incorporation into their equipment.  Prior to using a supplier, we prequalify each foundry and assembly subcontractor.  Wafers supplied by outside foundries must meet our incoming quality and test standards.  We conduct a portion of our test operations on advanced mixed signal and digital test equipment in our Burnaby facility. The remainder of our testing is performed predominantly by independent U.S. and Asian companies.

 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

 

Our current research and development efforts are targeted at integrating multiple channels or functions on single chips, broadening the number of products we provide to address varying protocols and networking functions, and increasing the speeds at which our chips operate.

 

From time to time we announce new products to the public once development of the product is substantially completed, and there are no longer significant costs to be incurred. As we have a portfolio of more than 180 products, we do not consider any individual new product or group of products released in a year to be material, beyond our continuing development of a portfolio of products that meet our customers future needs.

 

At the end of fiscal 2003, we had design centers in the United States (California, Oregon, and Pennsylvania) and Canada (British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec).  During 2003, we closed design centers in Maryland, Ireland and India as a result of corporate restructuring activities.

 

We spent  $119.5 million in 2003, $137.7 million in 2002 and $201.1 million in 2001 on research and development.

 

BACKLOG

 

We sell primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders.  Our customers frequently revise the

 

10


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

quantity and the shipment schedules to reflect changes in their needs.  We believe orders placed for delivery in excess of six months are not firm orders. As of December 31, 2003, our backlog of products scheduled for shipment within six months totaled $63.5 million. Unless our customers cancel or defer to a subsequent year a portion of this backlog, we expect this entire backlog to be filled in 2004.  Our backlog of products as of December 31, 2002 for shipment within six months totaled $41.0 million.

 

Our backlog includes our backlog of shipments to direct customers, minor distributors and a portion of shipments by our major distributor to end customers.   Our customers may cancel, or defer to a future period, a significant portion of the backlog at their discretion without penalty.  Accordingly, we believe that our backlog at any given time is not a meaningful indicator of future long-term revenues.

 

COMPETITION

 

We typically face competition at the design stage when our networking customers determine which communications semiconductor components to use in their next generation equipment designs.

 

Most of our customers choose a particular semiconductor component primarily based on whether the component:

 

•                  meets the functional requirements;

•                  addresses the required protocols;

•                  interfaces easily with other components in a design;

•                  meets power usage requirements;

•                  is priced competitively; and

•                  is brought to market on a timely basis.

 

OEMs are becoming more price conscious than in the past as a result of the downturn in the telecommunications industry, and as semiconductors sourced from third party suppliers comprise a greater portion of the total materials cost in OEM equipment.   We have also experienced aggressive price competition from our competitors.  These circumstances may make some of our products less competitive, and we may be forced to decrease our prices significantly to win a design.

 

In addition to price, OEMs will also consider the quality of the supplier when determining which component to include in a design.  Many of our customers will consider the breadth and depth of the supplier’s technology, as using one supplier for a broad range of technologies can often simplify and accelerate the design of next generation equipment.   OEMs will also consider a supplier’s design execution reputation, as many OEMs design their next generation equipment concurrently with the component design.  OEM’s also consider whether a supplier has been pre-qualified, as this ensures that components made by that supplier will meet the OEM’s quality standards.

 

Our competitors may be classified into two major groups.  First, we compete against established peer-group semiconductor companies that focus on the communications semiconductor business.  These companies include Agere Systems, Applied Micro Circuits

 

11


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 

Corporation, Broadcom, Emulex, Exar Corporation, Conexant Systems, Marvell Technology Group, Qlogic, Silicon Image, Transwitch and Vitesse Semiconductor.  These companies are well financed, have significant communications semiconductor technology assets, have established sales channels, and depend on the market in which we participate for the bulk of their revenues.

 

Second, we also compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, including Agilent, Cypress Semiconductor, Intel, IBM, Infineon, Integrated Device Technology, Maxim Integrated Products, Motorola, and Texas Instruments.  These companies are concentrating an increasing amount of their substantial financial and other resources on the markets in which we participate.

 

Over the next few years, we expect additional competitors, some of which may also have greater financial and other resources, to enter the market with new products.

 

We are also expanding into some markets, such as the storage and wireless infrastructure and generic microprocessor markets, that have established incumbents with substantial financial and other resources.  Some of these incumbents derive a majority of their earnings from these markets.  We expect continued strong  competition in these markets.

 

LICENSES, PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

 

We rely in part on patents to protect our intellectual property and have been awarded 152 U.S. and 75 foreign patents for circuit designs and other innovations used in the design and architecture of our products.  In addition, we have 89 patent applications pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office.  Our patents expire typically 20 years from the patent application date if accepted, with our existing patents expiring between 2010 and 2022.

 

We do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any one patent, although we believe that a strong portfolio of patents combined with other factors such as our ability to innovate, technological expertise and the experience of our personnel are important to compete effectively in the industry.  A portfolio of patents also provides the flexibility to negotiate or cross license intellectual property with other semiconductor companies to broaden the features in our products.

 

To protect our other intellectual property we rely on mask work protection, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements.

 

Our only material license is the MIPS microprocessor architecture license from MIPS Technologies Inc., on which our microprocessor-based products are based.  While the desktop microprocessor market is dominated by the Intel Corporation’s “x86” complex instruction set computing, or CISC, architecture, several microprocessor architectures have emerged for other microprocessor markets.  Because of their higher performance and smaller space requirements, most of the competing architectures, like the MIPS architecture, are reduced instruction set computing, or RISC architectures.  The MIPS architecture is widely supported through semiconductor design software, operating systems and companion integrated circuits.  Because this license is the architecture behind our microprocessors, we must be able to retain
