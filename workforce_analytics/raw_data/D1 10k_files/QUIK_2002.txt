ITEM 1. BUSINESS 


Overview 

        QuickLogic Corporation develops, markets and supports advanced field programmable gate array, or FPGA, and embedded standard product, or ESP, semiconductors and the software tools that enable design engineers to use our products. We introduced ESPs, a new class of semiconductor devices, in 1998, to address the design community's demand for a solution that bridges the gap between existing application specific integrated circuit, or ASIC, options and the long-sought goal of system-on-a-chip. Specifically, our ESP devices provide engineers with the ease-of-use, guaranteed functionality and high-performance of standard products, combined with the flexibility of programmable logic. Our ESP and FPGA products target complex, high-performance systems in rapidly changing markets where system manufacturers seek to minimize time-to-market and maximize product differentiation and functionality. We compete in various markets, including telecommunications and data communications; video/audio, graphics and imaging; instrumentation and test; high-performance computing; and military systems. 

        In August 2001, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of V3 Semiconductor, Inc. ("V3"), a manufacturer of application specific standard products, or ASSPs. The acquisition of V3 provides us with a design center in Canada and additional ASSP products that complement certain of our ESP products. 

Product Technology 

        The key components of our ESP and FPGA product families are our ViaLink programmable metal technology, our user-programmable platform and the associated software tools used for product design. Our ViaLink technology allows us to create smaller devices than competitors' comparable products, thereby minimizing silicon area and cost. In addition, our ViaLink technology has lower electrical resistance and capacitance than other programmable technologies and, consequently, supports higher signal speed. Our user-programmable platform facilitates full utilization of a device's logic cells and Input/Output pins. These logic cells have been optimized to efficiently implement a wide range of logic functions at high speed, thereby enabling greater usable device density and design flexibility. Our architecture uses our ViaLink technology to maximize interconnects at every routing wire intersection. The abundance of interconnect resources allows more paths between logic cells. As a consequence, system designers are able to use QuickLogic devices with smaller gate counts than competing FPGAs to implement their designs. These smaller gate-count devices require less silicon area and as a result are able to be offered at a lower price. Finally, our software enables our customers to efficiently implement their designs using our products. 

Industry Background 

        Competitive pressures are forcing manufacturers of electronic systems to rapidly bring to market products with improved functionality, higher performance and greater reliability, all at lower cost.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Providers of systems requiring high-speed data transmission and processing such as communications equipment, digital image products, test and instrumentation and storage subsystems face intense time-to-market pressures. These market forces have driven the evolution of logic semiconductors, which are used in complex electronic systems to coordinate the functions of other semiconductors, such as microprocessors or memory. There are three types of advanced logic semiconductors: 

•
Application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, are special purpose devices designed for a particular manufacturer's electronic system. These devices are customized during wafer manufacturing; 


•
Application specific standard products, or ASSPs, are fixed-function devices designed to comply with industry standards that can be used by a variety of electronic systems manufacturers. Their functions are fixed prior to wafer fabrication; and 


•
Programmable logic devices, or PLDs, are general-purpose devices which can be used by a variety of electronic systems manufacturers, and are customized after purchase for a specific application. Field programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, are types of PLDs used for complex functions. 
        Systems manufacturers have relied heavily on ASICs to implement the advanced logic required for their products. ASICs provide high performance due to customized circuit design. However, because ASICs are design-specific devices, they require long development and manufacturing cycles, delaying product introductions. In addition, because of the expense associated with the design of ASICs, they are cost effective only if they can be manufactured in high volumes. Finally, once ASICs are manufactured, their functionality cannot be changed to respond to evolving market demands. 

        ASSPs have become widely utilized as industry standards have developed to address increasing system complexity and the need for communication between systems and system components. These standards include: 

•
Peripheral component interconnect, or PCI, a standard developed to provide a high performance, reliable and cost-effective method of connecting high-speed devices within a system; 


•
Synchronous optical network, or SONET, a fiber-optic transmission standard for high-speed digital traffic, employed mainly by telephone companies and other network service providers; 


•
Ethernet, a widely-used local area network, or LAN, transport standard which controls the interconnection between servers and computers; and 


•
Fibre channel interconnect protocol, an industry networking standard for storage area networks, or SANs, which controls the interconnection between servers and storage devices. 
        Compared to ASICs, ASSPs offer the systems designer shorter development time, lower risk and reduced development cost. However, ASSPs generally cannot be used by systems manufacturers to differentiate their products. To address markets where industry standards do not exist or are changing and time-to-market is important, PLDs are often used. These products provide systems manufacturers with the flexibility to customize and thereby differentiate their systems, unlike ASSPs. PLDs also enable systems manufacturers to change the logic functionality of their systems after product introduction without the expense and time of redesigning an ASIC. However, most PLDs are more expensive than ASSPs and even ASICs of equivalent functionality because they require more silicon area. In addition, most PLDs offer lower performance than nonprogrammable solutions, such as ASSPs and ASICs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Industry Future: System-on-a-Chip 

        Over the past few years, semiconductor manufacturers have migrated to smaller process geometries. These smaller process geometries enable more logic elements to be incorporated in a single chip using less silicon area. More recently, advances have been made in the integration of logic and memory on a single chip, which had been difficult previously due to incompatible process technologies. The industry "holy grail" is to have the three basic components of all electronic circuit boards; logic, memory and a microprocessor, on the same chip. Advantages of the single-chip approach to systems manufacturers include: 

•
simplified system development; 


•
reduced time-to-market; 


•
elimination of delays associated with the transfer of data between chips; 


•
smaller physical size; 


•
lower power dissipation; 


•
greater reliability; and 


•
lower cost. 
        However, as levels of logic integration have increased, devices have become more specific to a particular application. This fact limits their use and potential market size. 

QuickLogic's ESP Solution 

        QuickLogic has leveraged its unique ViaLink technology and user-programmable platform to address the limitations inherent in current system-on-a-chip approaches. The result is embedded standard products, or ESPs, that deliver the advantages offered by both FPGAs and ASSPs. In its simplest form, an ESP contains four basic parts: a programmable logic array, an embedded standard function, an optional programmable read-only memory to configure the embedded function, and an interface that allows communication between the standard function and programmable logic array. Our ESP products combine the system-level functionality of ASSPs with the flexibility of FPGAs. We believe ESPs offer the following specific advantages: 

•
Increased Performance. In a typical design, data must travel between an ASSP and an FPGA across a printed circuit board. The limited number of connections available and the distance between the devices can degrade the system's overall performance. Our ESP solution allows all data to be processed on a single chip; 


•
Decreased Cost. Because our ESP is a single chip solution, it requires less silicon area, and therefore is less expensive to produce. Additionally, this single chip approach lowers the component, assembly and test cost for the system manufacturer; 


•
Increased Reliability. ESP designs are more reliable because single chip solutions contain fewer components and circuit board connections that are subject to failure; and 


•
Shorter Development Time. With a multiple chip design, systems designers must solve complex routing and timing issues between devices. A single chip ESP solution eliminates the timing issues between devices and simplifies software simulation, leading to shorter development time. 
        We have introduced six ESP product lines since 1998. These include the QuickSD, QuickFC and QuickPCI families—products aimed at the high-speed interconnect section of the fast-growing communications market. In addition we have introduced QuickDSP and QuickRAM, for high-performance Digital Signal Processing, or DSP, applications and applications that require 

3


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


embedded memory. Most recently we have introduced our QuickMIPS family to serve applications that require an embedded microprocessor. All of these families are designed for performance-driven applications. 

QuickLogic's FPGA Solution 

        QuickLogic's FPGAs offer higher performance at lower overall systems cost than competing FPGA solutions, in addition to offering the advantages typically associated with FPGAs. Specifically, our products provide greater design flexibility than standard FPGAs and enable designers of complex systems to achieve rapid time-to-market with highly differentiated products. Our products are based on our ViaLink technology and user-programmable platform, and our associated QuickWorks and QuickTools design software. 

        During 2000, we introduced a new FPGA family called Eclipse—devices that offer a host of new system-level features that are ideal for the telecommunications, networking, computer and test applications that require a combination of high-performance, high density and embedded random access memory, or RAM. In addition, we continue to sell our three families of pASIC FPGAs. 

The QuickLogic Strategy 

        Our objective is to be the indispensable provider of high-speed, flexible, cost-effective ESPs. We feel we can achieve this objective by offering systems manufacturers the ability to accelerate design cycles to satisfy demanding time-to-market requirements. To achieve our objective, we have adopted the following strategies: 

Extend Technology Leadership 

        Our ViaLink technology, user-programmable platform and proprietary software design tools enable us to offer flexible, high-performance ESP products. We intend to continue to invest in the development of these technologies and to utilize such developments in future innovations of our ESP products. We also intend to focus our resources on building critical systems-level expertise to introduce new ESP products and enhance existing ESP product families. We target applications that are: 

•
high performance and high complexity; 


•
broadly used and growing quickly; and 


•
difficult or impossible to implement in traditional FPGAs. 


        Specifically, we will continue to focus our design and marketing efforts on systems manufacturers who sell complex systems within our target applications. These include: 

•
data communications and telecommunications; 


•
video/audio and graphics and imaging; 


•
instrumentation and test; 


•
high-performance computing; and 


•
military. 
Provide Complete System Solutions 

        Our focus on a more targeted set of applications areas will allow us to provide a complete solution to systems manufacturers. This includes not only the device and software, but software drivers, 

4


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


reference designs, test boards and complementary intellectual property, or IP, functions. We focus ESP development efforts on three strategic applications areas: 

•
embedded high performance digital signal processing, or DSP; 


•
embedded high-performance interconnect; and 


•
embedded high-performance processing. 
Strategic Alliances 

        As a part of our ESP strategy, we have engaged with MIPS Technologies, Finisar, UTMC, Tower Semiconductor, and other companies to expand the range of technology that we embed in our products. In addition, we continue to sell through a network of industry sales representatives and distributors. These alliances will be an essential element of our ESP strategy and strength going forward. By leveraging the expertise of our partners in IP development, wafer fabrication and sales, we can devote our effort to the development of targeted, complete ESP products. 

Create Innovative, Industry-Leading Customer Services 

        We continue to develop and implement innovative ways to serve and communicate with our customers. For example, our WebASIC service allows customers to use our development software to design a circuit, transmit design information over the Internet and receive a QuickLogic ESP or FPGA device programmed with their design (within one business day in North America and Europe or within two business days in Asia). In addition, our ProChannel web-based system allows our distributors to receive quotations, place orders for our products and view their order status over the Internet. This system complements the Electronic Data Interchange systems that we have used for the past several years with our largest customers. 

        We have recently added a new class of products and their associated delivery system called WebESP. These products are ESPs or FPGAs that are configured in our factory and sold over the Internet as application specific standard products. The first WebESP products are semiconductor devices that form bridges between electronic systems using various forms of the UTOPIA communication protocol. Our ViaLink, non-volatile programmable logic devices give us the ability to configure the many variables needed to accommodate many different UTOPIA options and ship the devices to systems manufacturers who use them as ASSPs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Competition 

        The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by constant technological change, rapid rates of product obsolescence and price erosion. Our existing competitors include suppliers of conventional standard products, such as PLX Technology and Applied Micro Circuits Corporation; suppliers of complex programmable logic devices, or CPLDs, including Lattice Semiconductor and Altera; and suppliers of FPGAs, particularly Xilinx and Actel. Xilinx and Altera dominate the PLD market, which together control over 60% of the market, according to inSearch Research, a semiconductor market research firm. Xilinx dominates the FPGA segment of the market while Altera dominates the CPLD segment of the market. We also face competition from companies that offer standard gate arrays, which can be obtained at a lower cost for high volumes and may have gate densities and performance equal or superior to our products. As we introduce additional ESPs, we will also face competition from standard product manufacturers who are already servicing or who may decide to enter the markets addressed by these new ESP devices. In addition, we expect significant competition in the future from major domestic and international semiconductor suppliers. We also may face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies. 

        We believe that important competitive factors in our market are length of development cycle, price, performance, installed base of development systems, adaptability of products to specific applications, ease of use and functionality of development system software, reliability, technical service and support, wafer fabrication capacity and sources of raw materials, and protection of products by effective utilization of intellectual property laws. 

Research and Development 

        Our future success will depend to a large extent on our ability to rapidly develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products that meet emerging industry standards and satisfy changing customer requirements. We have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and to participate in the development of new and existing industry standards. 

        As of February 18, 2002, the research and development staff consisted of 60 employees working in several groups. Our research and development efforts are directed at the complete range of requirements of our ESP products. 

•
Our process engineering group develops our proprietary ViaLink wafer manufacturing process, oversees product manufacturing and process development with our third-party foundries, and is involved in ongoing process improvements to increase yields and optimize device characteristics. 


•
Our analog engineering group develops high-performance analog circuits to support our ESP products. 


•
Our FPGA design engineering group develops high-performance programmable systems that can be used stand-alone or combined with high value dedicated functions to form ESP products. 


•
Our ASIC design engineering group develops or integrates dedicated IP that is combined with a programmable system to produce ESP products. 


•
Our FPGA software group develops the design libraries, interface routines and place and route software that allows our customers to use third-party design environments to develop designs for our programmable systems and subsystems. 


•
Our embedded systems group develops the software required to program and use our MIPS based products. 
7


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


        Our research and development expenses for 1999, 2000 and 2001 were $7.4 million, $9.3 million and $14.3 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to research and development in the future. 

Manufacturing 

        We have established close relationships with third-party manufacturers for our wafer fabrication, package assembly, test and programming requirements in an effort to ensure stability in the supply of our products and minimize the risk of localized capacity constraints. 

        We currently outsource all of our wafer manufacturing to Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (Cypress) at its Round Rock, Texas facility and to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) at its Taiwan facilities. Cypress manufactures our pASIC1 and pASIC2 product families using a three-layer metal, 0.65 micron CMOS process on six-inch wafers. TSMC manufactures our pASIC3, QuickRAM and QuickPCI product families using a four-layer metal, 0.35 micron CMOS process. TSMC also manufactures our Eclipse and other ESP products using a five-layer metal, 0.25 micron process on eight-inch wafers. Our Cypress agreement provides a guaranteed capacity availability. We purchase products from TSMC on a purchase order basis. 

        On December 12, 2000 we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (Tower) under which we agreed to make a $25 million strategic investment in Tower as part of Tower's plan to build a new wafer fabrication facility. The new fabrication facility will produce 200-mm wafers in geometries of 0.18 micron and below, using advanced CMOS technology from Toshiba. In return for our investment, we will receive equity and committed production capacity in the advanced fabrication facility that Tower is building. Tower will develop manufacturing capability for our proprietary ViaLink technology, and supply us with a guaranteed portion of the new fabrication facility's available wafer capacity at competitive pricing, with first production expected in 2002. 

        We outsource our product packaging, test and programming to Amkor Technology and ChipPAC, Inc. at their South Korea facilities and to Advanced Semiconductor Engineering at its Taiwan facility, among others. 

Employees 

        As of February 18, 2002, we had a total of 189 employees worldwide, with 40 people in operations, 60 people in research and development, 22 people in sales, 32 people in marketing and 35 people in administration. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we believe our employee relations are good. 

Intellectual Property 

        Our future success and competitive position depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain the proprietary technology used in our principal products. We hold 81 U.S. patents and have 12 pending applications for additional U.S. patents containing claims covering various aspects of programmable integrated circuits, programmable interconnect structures and programmable metal devices. In addition, we have two patent applications pending in Japan and one granted. Our issued patents expire between 2009 and 2019. We have also registered six of our trademarks in the U.S. with applications to register an additional two trademarks now pending. 

        Because it is critical to our success that we are able to prevent competitors from copying our innovations, we intend to continue to seek patent protection for our products. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive, and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents, or that, even if patents are issued, they will be 

8


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. Furthermore, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own. 

        We also rely on trade secret protection for our technology, in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. However, employees may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In any case, others may come to know about or determine our trade secrets through a variety of methods. In addition, the laws of certain territories in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. 

        From time to time, we receive letters alleging patent infringement or inviting us to take a license to other parties' patents. We evaluate these letters on a case-by-case basis. In September 1999, we received an offer to license a patent related to field programmable gate array architecture. We have not yet determined whether this license would be necessary or useful and obtainable at a reasonable price. Offers such as these may lead to litigation if we reject the opportunity to obtain the license.

Executive Officers 

        Our executive officers are elected by, and serve at the discretion of, our board of directors. There are no family relationships among our directors and officers. 

Board of Directors 

        We currently have authorized five directors. Our directors consist of Messrs. Beadle, Boehlke, Callahan, Chua and Hart. All directors hold office for a term of three years. Our certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors will be divided into three classes, each with staggered three-year terms. As a result, only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. Messrs. Beadle and Callahan have been designated as Class I directors, whose terms expire at the 2003 annual meeting of stockholders; Mr. Chua has been designated as a Class II director, whose term expires at the 2004 annual meeting of stockholders; and Mr. Hart and Mr. Boehlke have been designated as Class III directors, whose terms expire at the 2002 annual meeting of stockholders. 

Board Committees 

        Our board of directors has an audit committee and a compensation committee. 

        Audit Committee.    The audit committee was formed in June 1995 and currently consists of Messrs. Beadle, Boehlke and Callahan. The audit committee reviews the results and scope of the annual audit and other services provided by our independent accountants, reviews and evaluates our internal control functions and monitors financial transactions between us and our employees, officers and directors.
