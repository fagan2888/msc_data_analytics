OVERVIEW 

    We are a leading provider of fiber optic subsystems and network test and monitoring systems which enable high-speed data communications over local area networks, or LANs, storage area networks, or SANs, and metropolitan access networks, or MANs. We are focused on the application of digital fiber optics to provide a broad line of high-performance, reliable, value-added optical subsystems for data networking and storage equipment manufacturers. Our line of optical components and subsystems supports a wide range of network applications, transmission speeds, distances and physical mediums. We also provide network performance test and monitoring systems which assist networking and storage equipment manufacturers in the efficient design of reliable, high-speed networking systems and the testing and monitoring of the performance of these systems. We sell our products to leading networking and storage equipment manufacturers such as Brocade, EMC and Emulex as well as emerging manufacturers such as ONI Systems, Inc. 

    We have recently acquired five privately-held companies in order to gain access to new technologies which can be used in conjunction with our existing core competencies to develop new and innovative products. During our fiscal year ended April 30, 2001, we acquired Sensors Unlimited, Inc., Demeter Technologies, Inc., Medusa Technologies, Inc., and Shomiti Systems, Inc. On May 3, 2001, we completed the acquisition of Transwave Fiber, Inc. These acquisitions broaden our product offerings and provide us access to advanced optical component technologies that we believe will enable us to develop more integrated subsystems and accelerate the product development cycle.

Recent Developments 

    Marlow Industries, Inc.  On February 20, 2001, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire Marlow Industries, Inc. On June 19, 2001, we announced that we had terminated the proposed acquisition according to the pertinent provisions of the merger agreement due to adverse economic conditions, particularly within the telecommunications market, and its impact on the business of Marlow. 

    Acquisition of Manufacturing Facility in Malaysia.  On May 10, 2001, we purchased a manufacturing facility in Ipoh, Malaysia, for a cash payment of $10 million, of which $2 million was for processing equipment and $8 million was for a building consisting of approximately 700,000 square feet of space, 200,000 square feet of which is suitable for cleanroom operations. The $8 million payment for the building is being held in escrow pending approval by the Malaysian government of the transfer of the real property. 

Industry Background 

    The ubiquity of computing by businesses, organizations and individuals worldwide and the need to interconnect multiple computing and storage devices to enable widespread communications has given rise to the multi-billion dollar computer networking and storage industries. The rapid growth in the number of corporate and residential users accessing communications networks and the proliferation of new applications designed for electronic commerce, communications and entertainment has resulted in the digitization and accumulation of enormous amounts of data. A study by the Gartner Group released in May 2001 predicts that the amount of stored data will increase at a compound growth rate of over 100% per year from 2000 through 2004. In addition, the value of much of this data has become increasingly mission-critical to the business enterprise and other organizations which must ensure that it is accessible on a reliable basis by employees, suppliers and customers over a diverse geographic area at all times. The need to quickly transmit, store and retrieve large blocks of data across these networks in a cost effective manner has resulted in large-scale equipment expenditures by enterprises and service providers to expand the capacity, or bandwidth, of their network and storage infrastructures using fiber optic transmission technology. 

Evolution of Data Networks and Storage Networks 

    Data networks are frequently segregated by distance and hardware and software protocols used to transport the data. As a result, the major network segments are frequently referred to as WANs, MANs, LANs and SANs. The technologies used to build these networks are continuously evolving but retain a common thread—the growing use of digital fiber optics to increase capacity and performance. 

    Digital Fiber Optics.  Digital fiber optic transmission technology was originally developed for use in WANs to increase the capacity and performance of long distance telecommunications networks. In contrast, LANs, SANs and MANs, with their relatively limited performance requirements, short connection distances and low transmission speeds, did not require the performance capabilities of fiber optics. Systems on these networks were generally interconnected using copper cabling or twisted pair wire. 

    As the need to access a common database of shared data and network resources became more widespread, it also created the need to connect users over greater distances. As the bandwidth, storage capacity and transmission distance requirements of enterprises and service providers have increased, it has become necessary to replace the limited transmission capabilities of copper cabling and twisted pair wire with the superior transmission capabilities of digital fiber optics to build practical, high-speed LANs, SANs and MANs. 

2


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    While studies suggest that the long-term demand for digital fiber optic systems used to upgrade LANs, SANs and MANs will continue to grow at a rapid pace, the demand for these products has recently slowed. This slowdown is believed to be the result of a combination of factors, including a buildup of excess inventory and a reduction in spending by business enterprises due to adverse economic conditions. 

    Interconnecting the various elements of these networks is accomplished with a transceiver, which combines a transmitter for converting an electrical signal into an optical signal for transmission over a fiber optic cable and a receiver for converting an optical signal into an electrical signal so that it can be processed by the network element in which the transceiver resides. Network elements generally include multiple transceivers, or ports, in order to be able to process several signals at the same time. 

    Cable television networks, or CATV, have traditionally relied on the use of radio frequency, or RF, analog transmission to broadcast video signals over copper cable. Since the early 1990's, CATV operators have greatly expanded their ability to offer a growing array of entertainment services by upgrading their networks with fiber optic technologies in order to expand capacity and enhance the reliability of their networks. However, the fiber optic technologies deployed to date continue to use RF analog transmission to send signals across these networks. Currently, some CATV operators are evaluating the use of digital fiber optic technologies in portions of their network in order to further enhance network capacity and reliability. These additional benefits arise primarily because digital fiber optic signals have an inherent ability to be transmitted over greater distances without the need for amplification and are more immune to mishandling problems, such as poor splices and connectors, than traditional analog links. 

    Gigabit Ethernet and Local Area Networks.  Early LANs were implemented to connect a limited number of users within relatively close proximity. Most of these LANs used the Ethernet transmission protocol which was developed to allow users to access the LAN and share basic common services such as file servers and printers. Because these early LANs had relatively limited performance requirements, short connection distances and low transmission speeds, systems on these LANs were generally connected by copper cabling. 

    As deployment of LANs increased, Ethernet has become the predominant LAN technology. As bandwidth needs and server processing power increased and larger numbers of users strained the early LAN infrastructure, Ethernet technology evolved from the original 10 megabits per second, or Mbps, version to 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet. In response to continually increasing bandwidth and performance requirements, Gigabit Ethernet technology, which operates at 1,000 Mbps, was introduced in 1998. The Dell O'ro Group estimates that shipments of Gigabit Ethernet ports shipped in switches will increase from 3.9 million in 2000 to over 55 million in 2005, representing a compound annual growth rate of 70%. Most of these Gigabit Ethernet ports will rely on fiber optic subsystems, which allow data to be transmitted accurately, at very high speeds and over long distances. Although the transmission speeds currently offered by Gigabit Ethernet are expected to meet the increasing bandwidth needs of enterprise and service provider networks for the near future, manufacturers have begun to develop networking systems with per-port transmission speeds of 10 gigabits per second, or Gbps, ten times faster than Gigabit Ethernet. Because of the scalability and migration capacity built into the Gigabit Ethernet protocol, manufacturers developing these systems are able to leverage this standard much as they did when they migrated from 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet to 1,000 Mbps Gigabit Ethernet. This next generation of high-speed networking systems will require even higher performance fiber optic subsystems. 

    Fibre Channel and Storage Area Networks.  Like data networking technology, data storage technology has evolved rapidly over the past decade. Traditionally, storage devices were connected to a single server and LAN in close proximity using a standard interface protocol known as the Small Computer Systems Interface, or SCSI. SCSI currently allows storage devices and servers to 

3


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

communicate at a maximum speed of 80 megabytes per second, over a maximum transmission distance of 12 meters and supports a maximum of 15 devices on a single bus. Although these distances and speeds were sufficient for early storage applications, SCSI has become a limiting technology for emerging storage applications, which require networking at high speeds over long distances and need to interconnect large numbers of users. 

    With the evolution of the Internet, the amount of data to be stored has increased to the point where the cost of managing and protecting this data has become the dominant cost of a typical information technology department, comprising as much as 70% of total expenditures. This in turn has created a demand for faster, more efficient interconnection of data storage systems with servers and LANs. Contributing to this demand are: 

•
the need to connect increasing numbers of storage devices and servers to a growing number of users; 


•
the need to interconnect servers and storage systems supplied by multiple vendors; 


•
the increasingly mission-critical nature of stored data and the need for rapid access to this data; and 


•
the expense and complexity associated with managing increasingly large amounts of data storage. 
    Although advances in technology, including the recent development of Gigabit Ethernet, increased LAN transmission speeds by more than 1,000 times during the 1990s, storage-to-server data transmission speeds on SCSI-based systems increased by less than ten times during this period. This speed disparity created a bottleneck between storage systems and servers and the LANs connected to those servers. In 1995, the Fibre Channel interconnect protocol was standardized to address the speed, distance and connectivity limitations of SCSI-based storage while maintaining backward compatibility with the installed base of SCSI-based storage systems. Fibre Channel allows up to 126 devices to communicate at rates up to 1.062 Gbps over distances of up to 10 kilometers. The Fibre Channel protocol has enabled the development of high-speed SANs which provide the interconnection between storage systems and servers. 

    Fibre Channel-based SANs provide many benefits, including transmission speeds comparable to high-speed LANs and transmission distances which allow broader sharing of resources. SANs also enable enhanced network applications such as storage backup, and better overall storage management achievable through centralized storage resources. In May 2001, the Gartner Group estimated that the use of SANs will increase as a percentage of total data storage systems from 24% in 2000 to 66% in 2004. In May 2001, IDC projected that the number of ports shipped in Fibre Channel systems, including switches, storage arrays and host bus adapters, or HBAs, will increase from 1.7 million in 2000 to 12.9 million in 2004, representing a compound annual growth rate of 65%. Most of these ports will rely on fiber optic subsystems to transmit and receive data at very high speeds with high accuracy, and often over long distances. Like manufacturers of Gigabit Ethernet-based LAN systems, manufacturers of Fibre Channel-based SAN systems are already developing the next generation of SAN products with speeds of 2.125 Gbps, twice as fast as current Fibre Channel speeds. Like Gigabit Ethernet, the Fibre Channel protocol is scalable, allowing for the potential development of systems with speeds of over 10 Gbps. The speeds contemplated by future generation SAN systems will require even higher performance fiber optics subsystems. 

    Metropolitan Access Networks.  The need for increased bandwidth is also increasing the demand for high-speed connectivity in MANs. The deployment of equipment for dense wavelength division multiplexing, or DWDM, has resulted in a 12,000% increase in capacity for long-haul networks since early 1997. Over the same period, the transmission of data within buildings and corporate campus networks has increased to gigabit speeds. However, connecting these islands of data is a "copper straw" where transmission rates are reduced to megabits per second or slower over a combination of twisted 

4


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pair, T-1 lines, frame relay and wireless links. The opportunities and technical challenges represented by this problem are considerable. Previous technologies used to upgrade WANs, such as DWDM, will likely not be economical to deploy in MANs. Instead, new technologies that use more cost effective coarse wavelength division multiplexing, or CWDM, are likely to be preferred in most of these networks. 

    CATV networks are increasingly being viewed as an alternative means of providing access to a broader range of communication services within metropolitan areas. With the rapid growth in Internet-related services, the demand for two-way interactive CATV services has also increased. The transformation of a one-way broadcast network to a two-way interactive network requires that the signals originating at each home be aggregated at a node before being sent back to the CATV network headend. This transformation, using analog signal transmission for the return path, involves numerous technical challenges because the electrical noise originating at each home is also aggregated before being transmitted. This aggregation of noise limits the amount of bandwidth and distance over which these return signals can be transmitted. For this reason, a substantial portion of CATV networks have not been upgraded for two-way transmission, while those which have implemented analog return path systems are limited with respect to their ability to carry two-way traffic. 

    The use of digital fiber optic solutions to upgrade these networks is in an early stage of development. 

Demand for High-Speed Data Communication Test Systems 

    The design and development of data and storage networking systems require extensive testing to ensure system performance and reliability. As new, highly complex transmission protocols such as Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel have emerged, system testing has become more difficult, requiring increasingly sophisticated and specialized test systems capable of capturing data at high speeds, filtering the data and identifying various types of intermittent errors and other network problems. Other new technologies are continually being developed, such as the Infiniband transmission protocol, which is being engineered to interconnect clusters of computer devices. In the past, many systems manufacturers designed their own test equipment each time they developed a new product. However, as the pace of technological change has accelerated, the performance requirements of data communications systems have increased and competition has afforded shorter market windows within which manufacturers can develop and introduce new products. Thus, system manufacturers have increasingly focused on the design and development of their own products and turned to specialized independent suppliers for state-of-the-art test equipment. As Ethernet and Fibre Channel-based systems reach even higher transmission speeds and new standards like Infiniband emerge, the internal development of test equipment by systems manufacturers will become more challenging, further increasing the demand for high performance, easy-to-use test systems from independent suppliers. 

Evolution of Fiber Optic Subsystems for Networking 

    The development and manufacture of high quality, cost-effective fiber optic subsystems for LANs, SANs and MANs present a number of significant technical challenges, including the following: 

•
As data rates increase, it becomes significantly more difficult to maintain data integrity because high speed signals can be degraded unless subsystem components such as lasers, detectors and integrated circuits are properly integrated and packaged; 


•
The increasingly mission-critical nature of data transmission and storage has magnified the impact of system failures, increasing the need for system reliability and the importance of real-time performance monitoring; 
5


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•
Manufacturers of high speed networking equipment require optical subsystems that support a wide range of transmission distances, protocols and applications; and 


•
Compliance with standards set by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, for electromagnetic interference emissions, or EMI, is significantly more difficult to achieve at higher data rates. 
    To date, we believe that only a limited number of companies have developed the specialized expertise required to engineer fiber optic subsystems and test systems which meet the requirements of manufacturers of high-speed data networking and storage systems. 

The Finisar Solution 

    We are a leading provider of fiber optic subsystems and network test and monitoring systems which enable high-speed data communications over LANs, SANs and MANs. We are focused on providing high-performance, reliable, value-added optical subsystems for networking and storage equipment manufacturers that develop and market systems based on Gigabit Ethernet, Fibre Channel and SONET protocols. Our line of optical subsystems supports a wide range of network applications, transmission speeds, distances and mediums. We also provide unique network test and monitoring systems that assist networking and storage equipment manufacturers in the efficient design of reliable, high-speed networking systems and the testing and monitoring of the performance of these systems. Our products provide the following key benefits to manufacturers of high-speed data networking and storage systems: 

    Value-Added Functions and Intelligence.  Our high-speed fiber optic subsystems are engineered to deliver value-added functionality and intelligence. For example, many of our optical subsystems include a microprocessor containing specially-developed software that allows customers to monitor the optical performance of each port on their systems in real time. In addition, many of our subsystems are engineered to automatically recognize different versions of the Fibre Channel protocol and to interoperate with our customers' older, installed networking systems, often referred to as legacy systems. Real-time monitoring and interoperability are particularly important in the Gigabit Ethernet LAN and Fibre Channel SAN markets where reliability and time to market are critical. Our test systems also contain value-added software functions that permit users to simulate and track errors. 

    High Level of Data Integrity.  Through the use of advanced packaging and circuit design, our optical subsystems deliver data at very high speeds over varying distances with very low error rates. We engineer our subsystems to exceed the industry standard error rate of 1 bit per trillion bits transmitted. This degree of data integrity allows our subsystems to operate reliably over a wide range of temperatures and other field conditions which we believe enables our customers to design and deliver more robust systems. 

    High Reliability.  We design all of our subsystems to provide the high reliability required for data networking and storage applications that are critical to an enterprise. Using standard statistical methodology and testing, we have been able to predict that some of our products can be expected to operate reliably for up to 40 million hours. Our subsystems are engineered to operate with minimal power requirements thereby increasing product life, and to function across a wide range of temperatures and voltages. This reliability and flexibility have allowed our subsystems to be designed into the products of manufacturers who provide systems for a variety of mission-critical applications. In addition, because our subsystems emit lower levels of electromagnetic interference, or EMI, than the standards set by the FCC, we offer manufacturers greater flexibility in the design of their systems and integration of other components and subsystems. 

    Broad Optical Subsystem Product Line.  We offer a broad line of optical subsystems which operate at varying protocols, speeds, fiber types, voltages, wavelengths and distances and are available in a 

6


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

variety of industry standard packaging configurations, or form factors. Our optical subsystems are designed to comply with key networking protocols such as Fibre Channel and Gigabit Ethernet and to plug directly into standard port configurations used in our customers' products. The breadth of our optical subsystems product line is important to many of our customers who manufacture a wide range of networking products for diverse applications. 

    Broad Test System Product Line.  We believe that we are a leading provider of network performance test systems for Fiber Channel-based networks. We offer a broad line of test systems to assist our customers in efficiently designing reliable, high-speed networking systems and testing and monitoring the performance of these systems. We believe our test systems enable our customers to focus their attention on the development of new products, reduce overall development costs and accelerate time to market. 

Strategy 

    Our objective is to be the leading provider of fiber optic subsystems and test systems to manufacturers of high-speed data networking and storage systems. Key elements of our strategy include the following: 

    Maintain Technology Leadership in High-Speed Fiber Optic Transmission.  We have been focused on the development of fiber optic subsystems since 1988. Current Finisar employees were actively involved in the original development of the Fibre Channel standard and, more recently, in the development and implementation of Gigabit Ethernet and the emerging Infiniband protocol. Our years of engineering experience, our multi-disciplinary technical expertise and our participation in the development of industry standards have enabled us to become a leader in the design and development of fiber optic subsystems and test systems. We intend to maintain our technological leadership through continual enhancement of our existing products and the development of new products as evolving technology permits higher speed transmission of data, with greater capacity, over longer distances. For example, we have designed new products to support emerging technologies such as 10 Gbps Ethernet, 2 Gbps Fibre Channel, and the Infiniband protocol. We are also focused on increased product integration to enhance the price/performance capabilities of our products. An example of this product integration is our new line of products for MANs using CWDM that combine passive optical technology from Transwave Fiber with our optical subsystems. We believe that these products have the potential to change the network architectures currently used for MANs. 

    Leverage Core Competencies Across Multiple, High-Growth Markets.  We believe that fiber optic technology will increasingly become the transmission technology of choice for multiple high-growth data communication markets, including Gigabit Ethernet-based LANs and MANs, Fibre Channel-based SANs. These markets are characterized by differentiated applications with unique design criteria such as product function, performance, cost, in-system monitoring, size limitations and software. We intend to target opportunities where our core competencies in high-speed data transmission protocols such as Gigabit Ethernet, Fibre Channel and Infiniband can be leveraged into leadership positions as these technologies are extended across multiple markets and applications. Our goal is to be the optical subsystem and network performance test system provider of choice for multiple protocols and network applications. 

    Strengthen and Expand Customer Relationships.  Over the past 12 years, we have established valuable relationships and a loyal base of customers by providing high-quality products and superior service. Our service-oriented approach has allowed us to work closely with leading data and storage network system manufacturers, understand and address their current needs and anticipate their future requirements. We intend to leverage our relationships with our existing customers as they enter new, high-speed data communications markets. We have recently established new customer relationships with several emerging Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel networking equipment manufacturers. We intend 

7


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to expand our sales and marketing organization in order to establish new relationships with other key data communications network manufacturers. 

    Capitalize on Cross-Selling Opportunities.  Many manufacturers of high-speed data networking and storage systems purchase both optical subsystems and test systems from third-party providers. Frequently, however, different groups or departments within a manufacturer's organization are responsible for qualifying and purchasing subsystems and test equipment. We are increasingly able to capitalize on our customers' satisfaction with one of our product lines and our service-oriented approach to gain valuable introductions that lead to sales of our other product lines. As this trend develops, we intend to leverage our unique expertise in both optical subsystems and test systems. In particular, the widespread acceptance of our Fibre Channel test systems and the introduction of our 10Gbps bit error rate tester for 10 Gigabit Ethernet systems are providing opportunities to develop new customers for our optical subsystems. 

    Acquire Critical Technologies.  The ability to develop innovative products frequently requires that we control the critical underlying technologies and core competencies to be used in the development process. This enhances our ability to speed the development process as well as to protect any intellectual property that might be created in the process. This has been the primary motivation for the acquisitions that we have completed to date. We acquired four companies during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2001, and completed the acquisition of a fifth company shortly after the end of the fiscal year, which we believe will enable us to respond more quickly to new market opportunities. We currently manufacture lasers through Demeter Technologies, photodiodes and arrays through Sensors Unlimited and passive components through Transwave Fiber. We believe that the acquisitions of Shomiti Systems and Medusa Technologies will enhance our position in testing and monitoring equipment for Fibre Channel, Gigabit Ethernet, Infiniband and FICON network protocols. In addition, we made minority investments in five other companies during the last fiscal year to give us access to additional technologies for developing new optical subsystems. We expect to continue to acquire new technologies that may enable us to introduce new innovative products, reduce our product cost or enhance our customer service. 

    Develop Low Cost Manufacturing Capabilities.  We believe that new markets can be created by the introduction of new low cost, high value-added products. Lower product costs can be achieved through the introduction of new disruptive technologies, product design or market presence. In each case, access to low-cost manufacturing resources will be a key factor in the ability to offer a low cost product solution. We have developed unique product designs and automated test processes that reduce the time to manufacture many of our products. During the past fiscal year, we developed relationships with a number of off-shore manufacturing companies to gain access to low-cost labor. In order to be able to transfer additional processes off-shore while maintaining greater control over our intellectual property, we recently purchased a manufacturing facility in Ipoh, Malaysia. We anticipate that we will commence volume manufacturing at our Malaysian facility in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, but will continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for a portion of our overall manufacturing requirements. 

Products 

    Per the guidelines established by the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS 131"), we have determined that, beginning in fiscal 2001, we operate in two segments: optical components and subsystems and network test and monitoring systems. 

    We provide a broad line of complementary products within these two segments for high-speed data communications over Gigabit Ethernet LANs and MANs and Fibre Channel SANs. As a result of recent acquisitions, we also provide a number of key optical components used in these optical subsystems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optical Subsystems 

    Our optical subsystems generally consist of optical data links for LANs and SANs and optical subsystems for MANs. 

    Optical Data Links.  Systems connected with fiber optics require optical subsystems to convert electrical signals into optical signals and back into electrical signals at high speeds. Our optical data links are integrated into our customers' systems and used for both short- and long-distance fiber optic communications. 

    Our family of optical data link products consists of transmitters, receivers and transceivers based on the Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel protocols. A transmitter converts electrical signals into optical signals for transmission over fiber optics. Photodetectors and receivers incorporating photodetectors convert incoming optical signals into electric signals. A transceiver combines both transmitter and receiver functions. Our optical data link products perform these functions with high reliability and data integrity and support a wide range of protocols, transmission speeds, fiber types, wavelengths, transmission distances, form factors and software enhancements. 

    Our high-speed fiber optic subsystems are engineered to deliver value-added functionality and intelligence. Most of our optical data link products include a microprocessor with proprietary embedded software that allows customers to monitor transmitted and received optical power, temperature, drive current and other link parameters of each port on their systems in real time. In addition, our intelligent optical data links are used by many enterprise networking and storage system manufacturers to enhance the ability of their systems to diagnose and correct abnormalities in fiber optic networks. 

    Optical Subsystems for MANs.  We have introduced a full line of optical subsystems for MANs using CWDM technologies designed to deliver dramatic cost savings to optical networking manufacturers as compared to solutions based on DWDM. CWDM systems use far fewer wavelengths, typically spaced 20 nanometers apart, to transport data from point-to-point or in a ring configuration. DWDM systems, which historically have been deployed for adding capacity in long-haul telecommunications networks, are typically designed for wavelengths spaced only 1.6 nanometers apart. While offering additional capacity, DWDM systems are far more complex and must be cooled, further adding to the cost of such systems. Our CWDM subsystems include every major optical transport component needed to support a MAN, including transceivers, optical add/drop muxes, or OADMs, and multiplexers/demultiplexers for SONET, Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel. These products are in the later stages of product development and are expected to be available for customer trials in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. 

    Our line of optical subsystems for MANs also includes products which use a new technical approach to the transportation of information inside CATV networks. Traditionally, fiber optic links in CATV networks have used analog modulation to transport signals. Our design digitizes the return path signal with performance comparable to the best analog links with the added benefits associated with the use of digital fiber optic technologies in terms of lower overall network costs and greater reliability. To date, we have sold products primarily for use in customer trials.

Optical Components 

    With the acquisitions of Sensors Unlimited, Demeter Technologies and Transwave Fiber, we gained access to active and passive components that can be utilized in designing and manufacturing new optical subsystems incorporating innovations arising from the integration of these newly acquired technologies. Sensors Unlimited provides expertise in Indium Phosphide semiconductor materials and the introduction of positive intrinsic negative, or PIN, receivers at 10 Gbps, optical performance monitors (OPMs) for monitoring wavelengths in DWDM systems as well as other optical devices now being incorporated into our line of optical transceivers. Demeter Technologies adds the capability for making Fabry Perot and distributed feedback lasers to be incorporated into our transceiver designs as well as to be sold into the merchant market. Passive components designed by Transwave Fiber will be important in developing cost-effective transmission systems and OADMs used in wavelength division multiplexing subsystems to eliminate bandwidth bottlenecks and expand the performance of MANs.

Customers 

    To date, our revenues have been principally derived from sales to customers who sell products for building and testing storage area networks. Approximately 70% of our total revenues were derived from sales to these customers in fiscal 1999, 65% in fiscal 2000 and 68% in fiscal 2001. Sales to our top three customers represented approximately 54% of our total revenues in fiscal 1999, 55% in fiscal 2000 and 48% in fiscal 2001. Sales to our top three customers, Brocade, EMC Corporation and Emulex, accounted for 20.1%, 17.3% and 11.0% of our total revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2001. 

Technology 

    The development of high quality fiber optic subsystems and test systems for high-speed data communications requires multidisciplinary expertise in the following technology areas: 

    High Frequency Semiconductor Design.  Our fiber optic subsystems development efforts are supported by an engineering team that specializes in analog/digital integrated circuit design. This group works in both silicon and gallium arsenide, or GaAs, semiconductor technologies where circuit element frequencies are very fast and can be as high as 60 gigahertz, or GHz. We have designed proprietary circuits including laser drivers and receiver pre- and post-amplifiers. Our designs have made us early entrants in the 1.0 Gbps data communications market and more recently in the 2.5 Gbps data 

12


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

communications market. These advanced semiconductor devices provide significant cost advantages and will be critical in the development of future products capable of even faster data rates. 

    Optical Subsystem Design.  Finisar has established itself as a low-cost design leader beginning with its initial Gbps optical subsystems in 1992. From that base we have developed new singlemode laser alignment approaches and low-cost, all-metal packaging techniques for improved EMI performance and environmental tolerance. We develop our own component and packaging and designs and integrate these designs with proprietary manufacturing processes that allow our products to be manufactured in high volume. 

    Complex Logic Design.  Our test equipment designs are based on field programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs. In recent customer trials, our newest products are being used to operate with clock frequencies of up to 125 megahertz, or MHz, and logic densities up to 1 million gates per chip. Our test systems use FPGAs that are programmed by the host PC and therefore can be configured differently for different tests. All of our logic design is done in the very high density logic, or VHDL, hardware description language which will enable migration to application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, as volumes warrant. We develop VHDL code in a modular fashion for reuse in logic design which comprises a critical portion of our intellectual property. This re-usable technology base of logic design is available for use in both our test system and optical subsystem product lines and allows us to reduce the time to market for our new and enhanced products. 

    Software Technology.  We devote substantial engineering resources to the development of software technology for use in all of our product lines. We have developed software to control our test systems, analyze data collected by our test systems, and monitor, maintain, test and calibrate our optical subsystems. A majority of our software technology and expertise is focused on the use of object-oriented development techniques to develop software subsystems that can be reused across multiple product lines. We have created substantial intellectual property in the area of data analysis software for our Fibre Channel test equipment. This technology allows us to rapidly sort, filter and analyze large amounts of data using a proprietary database format. This database format is both hardware platform-independent and protocol-independent. This independence allows all of the software tools developed for our existing test products to be utilized in all of our new test products that collect data traces. Because the database format is also protocol-independent, new protocols can be added quickly and easily. Another important component of our intellectual property is our graphical user interface, or GUI, design. Many years of customer experience with our test products have enabled us to define a simple yet effective method to display complex protocols in clear and concise GUIs for intuitive use by engineers. 

    System Design.  The design of all of our products requires a combination of sophisticated technical competencies—optical engineering, high-speed digital and analog design, ASIC design and software engineering. We have built an organization of people with skills in all of these areas. It is the integration of these technical competencies that enables us to produce products that meet the needs of our customers. Our combination of these technical competencies has enabled us to design and manufacture optical subsystems with built-in optical test multiplexing and network monitoring, as well as test systems that integrate optical and protocol testing with user interface software. 

    Manufacturing System Design.  The design skills gained in our test systems group are also used in the manufacturing of our optical subsystems. We utilize our high-speed FPGA design blocks and concepts and GUI software elements to provide specialized manufacturing test systems for our internal use. These test systems are optimized for test capacity and broad test coverage. We use automated, software-controlled testing to enhance the field reliability of all Finisar products. All of our products are subjected to temperature testing of powered systems as well as full functional tests.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Wafer Fabrication.  Following our acquisitions of Sensors Unlimited and Demeter Technologies we are developing new capabilities in InP (Indium Phosphide) integration. This compound semiconductor material system is useful for fabrication of laser diodes and photodiodes that operate at wavelengths between 1200 nanometers to 1700 nanometers. To date, we have developed a number of products based on access to wafer fabrication processing including Fabry Perot lasers and standard PIN and avalanche photodiodes (APD). Both lasers and photodiodes operate at 1, 2.5 and 10 Gbps. 

Competition 

    The market for optical components and subsystems and network test and monitoring systems for use in LANs, SANs and MANs is highly competitive. We believe the principal competitive factors in the optical subsystem and test system markets are: 

•
product performance, features, functionality and reliability; 


•
price/performance characteristics; 


•
timeliness of new product introductions; 


•
adoption of emerging industry standards; 


•
service and support; 


•
size and scope of distribution network; 


•
brand name; 


•
access to customers; and 


•
size of installed customer base. 
    We believe we compete favorably with our competitors with respect to most of the foregoing factors. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against either current or future competitors. 

Sales, Marketing and Technical Support 

    We sell our products in North America through our direct sales force and a network of independent manufacturers' representatives. For sales of our optical components and subsystems, we utilize a direct sales force augmented by eight domestic manufacturers' representatives and 13 international resellers. For sales of our network test and monitoring systems, we utilize a direct sales force augmented by nine domestic manufacturers' representatives and 33 international resellers. Our direct sales force maintains close contact with our customers and provides technical support to our manufacturers' representatives. In our international markets, our direct sales force works with local resellers who assist us in providing support and maintenance to the territories they cover. 

    Both our optical subsystems and our network performance test systems are often sold to the same customer. We are increasingly able to capitalize on our customers' satisfaction with one of our product lines and our service-oriented approach to gain valuable introductions that can lead to sales of our other product lines. We anticipate that we will continue to benefit from these trends in the future. 

    Our marketing efforts are focused on increasing awareness of our optical subsystems and test and monitoring systems product lines and our brand name. Key components of our marketing efforts include: 

•
continuing our active participation in industry associations and standards committees to promote and further enhance Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel technologies, promote standardization in the LAN, SAN and MAN markets, and increase our visibility as industry experts; and 


•
leveraging major trade show events and LAN, SAN, MAN and CATV conferences to promote our broad product lines. 
14


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    In addition, our marketing group provides marketing support services for our executive staff, our direct sales force and our manufacturers' representatives and resellers. Through our marketing activities, we provide technical and strategic sales support to our direct sales personnel and resellers including in-depth product presentations, technical manuals, sales tools, pricing, marketing communications, marketing research, trademark administration and other support functions. 

    A high level of continuing service and support is critical to our objective of developing long-term customer relationships. We emphasize customer service and technical support in order to provide our customers and their end users with the knowledge and resources necessary to successfully utilize our product line. Our customer service utilizes a technical team of field and factory applications engineers, technical marketing personnel and, when required, product design engineers. We provide extensive customer support throughout the qualification and sale process. In addition, we also provide many resources through our World Wide Web site, including product documentation and technical information. We intend to continue to provide our customers with comprehensive product support and believe it is critical to remaining competitive. 

Manufacturing 

    For most of the last fiscal year, we relied on three Asia based and one U.S. based contract manufacturer for substantially all of our assembly and test operations. We do not have long-term contracts with any of our contract manufacturers, and none of them are obligated to perform assembly services for us for any specific period or at any specified price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. We conduct manufacturing engineering, supply chain management, quality assurance and documentation control operations at our facility in Sunnyvale, California, as well as at our subsidiaries' facilities located in Princeton, New Jersey and El Monte, California. 

    We purchased a manufacturing facility in Malaysia in May 2001, consisting of 700,000 square feet, of which 200,000 square feet is suitable for cleanroom operations. This facility will allow us to transfer additional manufacturing processes to a lower-cost manufacturing location while maintaining greater control over our intellectual property than if we were to subcontract those operations. We expect to continue to use contract manufacturers for a portion of our manufacturing needs. 

    We design and develop a number of the key components of our products, including ASICs, printed circuit boards and software. In addition, our manufacturing team works closely with our engineers to manage the supply chain. Product testing and burn-in are performed at our facility. We also use inspection, testing and statistical process controls to assure the quality and reliability of our products. In addition, most of our optical subsystems have an intelligent interface that allows us to monitor product quality during the manufacturing process. 

    Although we use standard parts and components for our products where possible, we currently purchase a few key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources. Our principal single source components include ASICs and lasers. Generally, purchase commitments with our single or limited source suppliers are on a purchase order basis. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components, or the inability to procure these components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time, would substantially harm our business. In addition, qualifying additional suppliers can be time-consuming and expensive and may increase the likelihood of errors. 

    We use a rolling 12-month forecast based on anticipated product orders to determine our material requirements. Lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly, and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for a component at a given time. It is our practice to maintain a 12-month inventory of sole source components to decrease the risk of a component shortage. 

15


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research and Development 

    In fiscal 1999, fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001, our research and development expenses were $7.9 million, $13.8 million and $33.7 million, respectively. We believe that our future success depends on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop new products that maintain technological competitiveness. We focus our product development activities on addressing the evolving needs of our customers within the LAN, SAN and MAN markets. We work closely with our original equipment manufacturers and system integrators to monitor changes in the marketplace. We design our products around current industry standards and will continue to support emerging standards that are consistent with our product strategy. Our research and development groups are aligned with our different product lines and we have specific groups devoted to ASIC design and test, gigabit per second subsystem design, test equipment hardware and software design. In addition, our research and development also includes manufacturing engineer efforts whereby we examine each product for its manufacturability, predicted reliability, expected lifetime and manufacturing costs. 

    We are currently undertaking development efforts for our product lines with emphasis on increasing reliability, integrity and performance, as well as value-added functions. Some examples of products that we are working on are 10 Gbps Ethernet and CWDM optical subsystems. We also intend to focus on increased product integration to enhance the price/performance capabilities of our products. We believe that our research and development efforts are key to our ability to maintain technical competitiveness and to deliver innovative products that address the needs of the market. However, there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will result in commercially successful products, or that our products will not be rendered obsolete by changing technology or new product announcements by other companies. 

Intellectual Property 

    Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. To date, we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and know-how to protect our intellectual property. Although we have filed for several patents, some of which have issued, we cannot assure you that any patents will issue as a result of pending patent applications or that our issued patents will be upheld. Any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, existing patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technology. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our business. 

    The networking industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. From time to time, third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and in various jurisdictions that are important to our business. Any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties, if determined adversely to us, could significantly harm our business. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, cause product shipment delays or require us to 

16


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could significantly harm our business. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, our agreements with our customers typically require us to indemnify our customers from any expense or liability resulting from claimed infringement of third party intellectual property rights. In the event a claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement, our business would be significantly harmed. 

Employees 

    As of April 30, 2001, we employed approximately 760 full-time employees. We also from time to time employ part-time employees and hire contractors. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our employee relations are good. 


Factors That Could Affect Our Future Performance 


OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE. YOU SHOULD ALSO REFER TO THE OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES. 

Our future revenues are unpredictable, our operating results are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline significantly. 

    Our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance. Some of the factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate include market acceptance of our products and the Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel standards, market demand for the products manufactured by our customers, product development and production, competitive pressures and customer retention. 

    We may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenues for a number of reasons. Orders at the beginning of each quarter typically do not equal expected revenues for that quarter and are generally cancelable at any time. Accordingly, we depend on obtaining orders during a quarter for shipment in that quarter to achieve our revenue objectives. Failure to ship these products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, our customer agreements typically provide that the customer may delay scheduled delivery dates and cancel orders within specified time frames without significant penalty. Because we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term, any delay in generating or recognizing forecasted revenues could significantly harm our business. Beginning in the last quarter of fiscal 2001, we experienced reduced orders, and in some cases cancellations of existing orders, from our customers. As a result our revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 declined in comparison to the third quarter and are expected to decline in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 ending on July 31, 2001. 

    It is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In this event, the trading price of our common stock would significantly decline. 

17


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our success is dependent on the continued development of the emerging high-speed LAN, SAN and MAN markets. 

    Our optical subsystem and network test and monitoring system products are used exclusively in high-speed local area networks, or LANs, storage area networks, or SANs, metropolitan access networks, or MANs. Accordingly, widespread adoption of high-speed LANs, SANs and MANs is critical to our future success. The markets for high-speed LANs, SANs and MANs have only recently begun to develop and are rapidly evolving. Because these markets are new and evolving, it is difficult to predict their potential size or future growth rate. Potential end-user customers who have invested substantial resources in their existing data storage and management systems may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach, like high-speed LAN, SAN or MAN networks, particularly during periods of economic slowness. Our success in generating revenue in these emerging markets will depend, among other things, on the growth of these markets. There is significant uncertainty as to whether these markets ultimately will develop or, if they do develop, that they will develop rapidly. If the markets for high-speed LANs, SANs or MANs fail to develop or develop more slowly than expected, or if our products do not achieve widespread market acceptance in these markets, our business would be significantly harmed. 

We will face challenges to our business if our target markets adopt alternate standards to fibre channel and gigabit ethernet technology or if our products fail to comply with evolving industry standards and government regulations. 

    We have based our product offerings principally on Fibre Channel and Gigabit Ethernet standards and our future success is substantially dependent on the continued market acceptance of these standards. If an alternative technology is adopted as an industry standard within our target markets, we would have to dedicate significant time and resources to redesign our products to meet this new industry standard. Our products comprise only a part of an entire networking system, and we depend on the companies that provide other components to support industry standards as they evolve. The failure of these companies, many of which are significantly larger than we are, to support these industry standards could negatively impact market acceptance of our products. Moreover, if we introduce a product before an industry standard has become widely accepted, we may incur significant expenses and losses due to lack of customer demand, unusable purchased components for these products and the diversion of our engineers from future product development efforts. In addition, because we may develop some products prior to the adoption of industry standards, we may develop products that do not comply with the eventual industry standard. Our failure to develop products that comply with industry standards would limit our ability to sell our products. Finally, if new standards evolve, we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products in a timely fashion, if at all, that meet these new standards. 

    In the United States, our products must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the Federal Communications Commission and Underwriters Laboratories. Internationally, products that we develop also will be required to comply with standards established by local authorities in various countries. Failure to comply with existing or evolving standards established by regulatory authorities or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates could significantly harm our business. 

We depend on large purchases from a few significant customers, and any loss, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. 

    A small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. Our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers. Sales to our top four customers represented approximately 54% of total revenues in fiscal 

18


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1999, 55% in fiscal 2000 and 48% in fiscal 2001. Although we are attempting to expand our customer base, we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. 

    The markets in which we sell our products are dominated by a relatively small number of systems manufacturers, thereby limiting the number of our potential customers. Our dependence on large orders from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each customer critically important to our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers, that we will be able to attract additional customers or that our customers will be successful in selling their products that incorporate our products. We have in the past experienced delays and reductions in orders from some of our major customers. Several of our major customers have recently announced that orders for their products are slowing or that they are less certain about the demand for their products in the near future. As a result, beginning in the last quarter of fiscal 2001 we experienced reduced orders, and in some cases cancellations of existing orders, from our customers. In addition, our customers have in the past sought price concessions from us and will continue to do so in the future. Further, some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to joint ventures between these customers and our competitors. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or future price concessions that we may make could significantly harm our business. 

Because we do not have long-term contracts with our customers, our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time if we fail to meet our customers' needs. 

    We do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales. Accordingly: 

•
our customers can stop purchasing our products at any time without penalty; 


•
our customers are free to purchase products from our competitors; and 


•
our customers are not required to make minimum purchases. 
    Sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders, often with extremely short lead times. If we are unable to fulfill these orders in a timely manner, we will lose sales and customers. 

Our market is subject to rapid technological change, and to compete effectively we must continually introduce new products that achieve market acceptance. 

    The markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. We expect that new technologies will emerge as competition and the need for higher and more cost effective bandwidth increases. Our future performance will depend on the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address these changes as well as current and potential customer requirements. The introduction of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for existing products. We have in the past experienced delays in product development and such delays may occur in the future. Therefore, to the extent customers defer or cancel orders in the expectation of a new product release or there is any delay in development or introduction of our new products or enhancements of our products, our operating results would suffer. We also may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements, or to license these technologies from third parties. Product development delays may result from numerous factors, including: 

•
changing product specifications and customer requirements; 


•
difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel; 
19


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•
difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations; 


•
difficulties with contract manufacturers; 


•
changing market or competitive product requirements; and 


•
unanticipated engineering complexities. 
    The development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market or support new or enhanced products successfully, if at all, or on a timely basis. Further, we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors, technological changes or emerging industry standards. Any failure to respond to technological change would significantly harm our business. 

Continued competition in our markets may lead to a reduction in our prices, revenues and market share. 

    The markets for optical components and subsystems and network test and monitoring systems for use in LANs, SANs and MANs are highly competitive. Our current competitors include a number of domestic and international companies, many of which have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and distribution resources and brand name recognition than we have. We expect that more companies, including some of our customers, will enter the market for optical subsystems and network test and monitoring systems. We may not be able to compete successfully against either current or future competitors. Increased competition could result in significant price erosion, reduced revenue, lower margins or loss of market share, any of which would significantly harm our business. For optical subsystems, we compete primarily with Agilent Technologies, Inc., Infineon Technologies, International Business Machines Corporation, Stratos Lightwave (formerly Methode Electronics), Molex Premise Networks and Vixel Corporation. For network test and monitoring systems, we compete primarily with Ancot Corporation, I-Tech Corporation, Xyratex International and Network Associates. Our competitors continue to introduce improved products with lower prices, and we will have to do the same to remain competitive. In addition, some of our current and potential customers may attempt to integrate their operations by producing their own optical components and subsystems and network test and monitoring systems or acquiring one of our competitors, thereby eliminating the need to purchase our products. Furthermore, larger companies in other related industries, such as the telecommunications industry, may develop or acquire technologies and apply their significant resources, including their distribution channels and brand name recognition, to capture significant market share. 

Decreases in average selling prices of our products may reduce gross margins. 

    The market for optical subsystems is characterized by declining average selling prices resulting from factors such as increased competition, the introduction of new products and increased unit volumes as manufacturers continue to deploy network and storage systems. We have in the past experienced, and in the future may experience, substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to declining average selling prices. We anticipate that average selling prices will decrease in the future in response to product introductions by competitors or us, or by other factors, including price pressures from significant customers. Therefore, we must continue to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices. Failure to do so could cause our revenues and gross margins to decline, which would significantly harm our business. 

    We may be unable to reduce the cost of our products sufficiently to enable us to compete with others. Our cost reduction efforts may not allow us to keep pace with competitive pricing pressures or 

20


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lead to improved gross margins. In order to remain competitive, we must continually reduce the cost of manufacturing our products through design and engineering changes. We may not be successful in redesigning our products or delivering our products to market in a timely manner. We cannot assure you that any redesign will result in sufficient cost reductions to allow us to reduce the price of our products to remain competitive or improve our gross margin. 

Shifts in our product mix may result in declines in gross margins. 

    Our gross profit margins vary among our product families, and our gross margins are generally higher on our network test and monitoring systems than on our optical subsystems. Our gross margins are generally lower for newly introduced products and improve as unit volumes increase. Our overall gross margins have fluctuated from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix, the introduction of new products, decreases in average selling prices for older products and our ability to reduce product costs. As a result of a significant growth in sales of optical subsystem products over the past several quarters, including sales of new products to a number of new customers, we have experienced a sustained product shift toward a greater percentage of optical subsystem products resulting in a decline in overall gross margins. 

We are subject to pending legal proceedings. 

    In April 1999, Methode Electronics, a manufacturer of electronic component devices, filed a lawsuit against us and another manufacturer, Hewlett-Packard Co., alleging that our optoelectronic products infringe four patents held by Methode. The original complaint sought monetary damages and injunctive relief. Methode subsequently amended its complaint to add another manufacturer as an additional defendant, to allege infringement of a fifth Methode patent and to allege that we breached our obligations under a license and supply agreement with Methode by failing to provide Methode with unspecified information regarding new technology related to the products licensed under the agreement. The amended complaint seeks additional compensatory damages of at least $224.3 million plus interest for the alleged breach of contract. On June 5, 2000, Methode transferred the patents at issue in the litigation, as well as a number of other patents, to Stratos Lightwave LLC, and on June 21, 2000, Stratos Lightwave LLC transferred the same patents to Stratos Lightwave, Inc. Methode has made a motion to add Stratos Lightwave, Inc. to the lawsuit as an additional plaintiff. In September 2000, Methode and Stratos Lightwave filed a second lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging infringement of a sixth patent, which issued in August 2000. This patent is a reissue of a previous patent that is the parent of four of the five patents that are the subject of the original lawsuit filed by Methode against Finisar. In January 2001, Methode and Stratos Lightwave filed a third lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that our optoelectronic products infringe a seventh patent, which issued in July 1998. This patent is not directly related to the patents at issue in the first two lawsuits, but instead is directed to a different aspect of the same optoelectronic products that are in dispute in the other lawsuits. The claims against Hewlett-Packard were dismissed in May 2001 pursuant to a settlement agreement between Hewlett-Packard, Methode and Stratos Lightwave. 

    We believe that we have strong defenses against Methode's lawsuits, and we have filed counterclaims against Methode and Stratos Lightwave. Portions of our counterclaims in the first lawsuit, based on principles of state law, were dismissed in May 2000 on grounds of federal preemption; however, our basic claims of ownership of the patents remain subject to our pending counterclaims. 

    We intend to defend Methode's lawsuits and pursue our counterclaims vigorously. However, the litigation is in the preliminary stage, and we cannot predict its outcome with certainty. The litigation process is inherently uncertain and we may not prevail. Patent litigation is particularly complex and can extend for a protracted time, which can substantially increase the cost of such litigation. In connection 

21


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

with the Methode litigation, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial legal fees and expenses. The Methode litigation has also diverted, and is expected to continue to divert, the efforts and attention of some of our key management and technical personnel. As a result, our defense of this litigation, regardless of its eventual outcome, has been, and will likely continue to be, costly and time consuming. Should the outcome of the litigation be adverse to us, we could be required to pay significant monetary damages to Methode and could be enjoined from selling those of our products found to infringe Methode's patents unless and until we are able to negotiate a license from Methode. In the event that we obtain a license from Methode, we would likely be required to make royalty payments with respect to sales of our products covered by the license. Any such royalty payments would increase our cost of revenues and reduce our gross profit. If we are required to pay significant monetary damages, are enjoined from selling any of our products or are required to make substantial royalty payments pursuant to any such license agreement, our business would be significantly harmed. For a more complete discussion of this litigation matter, please refer to "Item 3.—Legal Proceedings." 

Our customers often evaluate our products for long and variable periods, which causes the timing of our revenues and results of operations to be unpredictable. 

    The period of time between our initial contact with a customer and the receipt of an actual purchase order may span a year or more. During this time, customers may perform, or require us to perform, extensive and lengthy evaluation and testing of our products before purchasing and using them in their equipment. Our customers do not typically share information on the duration or magnitude of these qualification procedures. The length of these qualification processes also may vary substantially by product and customer, and, thus, cause our results of operations to be unpredictable. While our potential customers are qualifying our products and before they place an order with us, we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort. Even after incurring such costs we ultimately may not sell any products to such potential customers. In addition, these qualification processes often make it difficult to obtain new customers, as customers are reluctant to expend the resources necessary to qualify a new supplier if they have one or more existing qualified sources. Once our products have been qualified, our agreements with our customers have no minimum purchase commitments. Failure of our customers to incorporate our products into their systems would significantly harm our business. 

We depend on contract manufacturers for substantially all of our assembly requirements, and if these manufacturers fail to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality products, our competitive position, reputation and business could be harmed. 

    We currently rely on four contract manufacturers for substantially all of our assembly requirements. We do not have long term contracts with any of these manufacturers. We have experienced delays in product shipments from contract manufacturers in the past, which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers. We may in the future experience similar delays or other problems, such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product, any of which could significantly harm our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our contract manufacturers or that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity. We intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements, which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers. The inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality products or the loss of any of our contract manufacturers would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and would significantly harm our business. If the demand for our products grows, we will need to increase our material purchases, contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality assurance functions. Any disruptions in product flow could limit our revenue, adversely affect our 

22


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

competitive position and reputation and result in additional costs or cancellation of orders under agreements with our customers. 

    We have recently begun to shift a substantial portion of our manufacturing requirements to our new facility in Malaysia. We may experience difficulty in implementing our manufacturing processes in this new facility, which could lead to production delays. The inability to obtain adequate supplies of high-quality products from our contract manufacturers to enable us to fulfill orders to our customers during any period in which we experience production delays would harm our business. 

    Additional risks associated with international manufacturing include: 

•
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; 


•
legal uncertainties regarding liability, tariffs and other trade barriers; 


•
inadequate protection of intellectual property in some countries; 


•
greater incidence of shipping delays; 


•
greater difficulty in overseeing manufacturing operations; 


•
potential political and economic instability; and 


•
currency fluctuations. 
    Any of these factors could significantly impair our ability to source our contract manufacturing requirements internationally. 

We may lose sales if our suppliers fail to meet our needs. 

    We currently purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources. We depend on these sources to meet our needs. Moreover, we depend on the quality of the products supplied to us over which we have limited control. We have encountered shortages and delays in obtaining components in the past and expect to encounter shortages and delays in the future. If we cannot supply products due to a lack of components, or are unable to redesign products with other components in a timely manner, our business will be significantly harmed. We have no long-term or short-term contracts for any of our components. As a result, a supplier can discontinue supplying components to us without penalty. If a supplier discontinued supplying a component, our business may be harmed by the resulting product manufacturing and delivery delays. 

    We use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our component requirements. Lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements, contract terms and current market demand for particular components. If we overestimate our component requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs. If we underestimate our component requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to our customers. Any of these occurrences would significantly harm our business. 

We are dependent on widespread market acceptance of two product families, and our revenues will decline if the market does not continue to accept either of these product families. 

    We currently derive substantially all of our revenue from sales of our optical components and subsystems and network test and monitoring systems. We expect that revenue from these products will continue to account for substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, widespread acceptance of these products is critical to our future success. If the market does not continue to accept either our optical components and subsystems or our network test and monitoring systems, our revenues will decline significantly. Factors that may affect the market acceptance of our 

23


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

products include the continued growth of the markets for LANs, SANs, MANs and CATV networks and, in particular, Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel-based technologies as well as the performance, price and total cost of ownership of our products and the availability, functionality and price of competing products and technologies. 

    Many of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, in order to achieve widespread market acceptance, we must differentiate ourselves from the competition through product offerings and brand name recognition. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in making this differentiation or achieving widespread acceptance of our products. Failure of our existing or future products to maintain and achieve widespread levels of market acceptance will significantly impair our revenue growth. 

Because of intense competition for technical personnel, we may not be able to recruit or retain necessary personnel. 

    We believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, technical, sales and marketing, finance and manufacturing personnel. In particular, we will need to increase the number of technical staff members with experience in high-speed networking applications as we further develop our product lines. Competition for these highly skilled employees in our industry is intense. Our failure to attract and retain these qualified employees could significantly harm our business. The loss of the services of any of our qualified employees, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel could hinder the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to sell our products. In addition, employees may leave our company and subsequently compete against us. Moreover, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices. We have been subject to claims of this type and may be subject to such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel. Some of these claims may result in material litigation. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims, regardless of their merits. 

Continued rapid growth will strain our operations and require us to incur costs to upgrade our infrastructure. 

    We have experienced a period of rapid growth, which has placed a significant strain on our resources. Unless we manage our growth effectively, we may make mistakes in operating our business, such as inaccurate sales forecasting, material planning and financial reporting, which may result in fluctuations in our operating results and cause the price of our stock to decline. We plan to continue to expand our operations significantly. This anticipated growth will continue to place a significant strain on our management and operational resources. In order to manage our growth effectively, we must implement and improve our operational systems, procedures and controls on a timely basis. If we cannot manage growth effectively, our business could be significantly harmed. 

Our products may contain defects that may cause us to incur significant costs, divert our attention from product development efforts and result in a loss of customers. 

    Networking products frequently contain undetected software or hardware defects when first introduced or as new versions are released. Our products are complex and defects may be found from time to time. In addition, our products are often embedded in or deployed in conjunction with our customers' products which incorporate a variety of components produced by third parties. As a result, when problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. These problems may cause us to incur significant damages or warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relation problems or loss of customers, all of which would harm our business. 

24


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our failure to protect our intellectual property may significantly harm our business. 

    Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. To date, we have relied primarily on proprietary processes and know-how to protect our intellectual property. Although we have filed for several patents, some of which have issued, we cannot assure you that any patents will issue as a result of pending patent applications or that our issued patents will be upheld. Any infringement of our proprietary rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenues. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, existing patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Accordingly, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technology. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our products is difficult. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our business. 

Claims that we infringe third-party intellectual property rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to sell our products. 

    The networking industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. We are currently involved in a series of related patent infringement lawsuits. For a more detailed discussion of these lawsuits, please refer to "Item 3—Legal Proceedings." In addition, from time to time, other parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and in various jurisdictions that are important to our business. Any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties, if determined adversely to us, could significantly harm our business. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could significantly harm our business. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, our agreements with our customers typically require us to indemnify our customers from any expense or liability resulting from claimed infringement of third party intellectual property rights. In the event a claim against us was successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement, our business would be significantly harmed. 

If we are unable to expand our direct sales operation and reseller distribution channels or successfully manage our expanded sales organization, our ability to increase our revenues will be harmed. 

    Historically, we have relied primarily on a limited direct sales organization, supported by third party manufacturers' representatives, to sell our products domestically and on indirect distribution channels to sell our products internationally. Our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and expanding our direct sales organization in North America and our indirect distribution channels internationally. We may not be able to successfully expand our direct sales organization and the cost of any expansion may exceed the revenue generated. To the extent that we are successful in expanding our direct sales organization, we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against the significantly larger and well-funded sales and marketing operations of many of our current or potential 

25


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

competitors. In addition, if we fail to develop relationships with significant international resellers or domestic manufacturers' representatives, or if these resellers or representatives are not successful in their sales or marketing efforts, sales of our products may decrease and our business would be significantly harmed. We have granted exclusive rights to substantially all of our resellers to sell our product and to our representatives to market our products in their specified territories. Our resellers and representatives may not market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales, marketing and technical support. Our inability to effectively manage the expansion of our domestic sales and support staff or maintain existing or establish new relationships with domestic manufacturer representatives and international resellers would harm our business. 

Recent, pending and future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and harm our operating results. 

    In October 2000, we completed the acquisition of Sensors Unlimited. In November 2000, we completed the acquisition of Demeter Technologies. In March 2001, we completed the acquisitions of Medusa Technologies and Shomiti Systems. In May 2001, we completed the acquisition of Transwave Fiber. We expect to continue to review opportunities to buy other businesses, products or technologies that would complement our current products, expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities, or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities. We issued stock to acquire Sensors Unlimited, Demeter Technologies, Shomiti Systems and Transwave Fiber. The issuance of stock in these transactions has diluted existing stockholders' percentage ownership. If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders' percentage ownership, incur substantial debt or assume contingent liabilities. 

Our experience in acquiring other business and technologies is limited. These recent, pending and potential acquisitions involve numerous risks, including: 

•
problems assimilating the purchased operations, technologies or products; 


•
unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition; 


•
diversion of management's attention from our core business; 


•
adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; 


•
risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and 


•
potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations. 
    We cannot assure you that we would be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions, and our inability to do so could significantly harm our business. 

Our executive officers and directors and entities affiliated with them own a large percentage of our voting stock, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control. 

    As of May 31, 2001, our executive officers, directors and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned approximately 64.0 million shares or 33.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. These stockholders, acting together, may be able to effectively control matters requiring approval by stockholders, including the election or removal of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock. 

26


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Delaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. 

    Some provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include: 

•
authorizing the board to issue additional preferred stock; 


•
prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; 


•
limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; 


•
prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent; 


•
creating a classified Board of Directors pursuant to which our directors are elected for staggered three-year terms; and 


•
establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings. 
Our headquarters and a portion of our manufacturing operations are located in Northern California where natural disasters may occur. 

    Currently, our corporate headquarters and a portion of our manufacturing operations are located in Northern California. Northern California historically has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, fires and floods, which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our and our manufacturers' property. We presently do not have redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would suffer. 

Our stock price is volatile and you may be unable to resell your shares at or above your purchase price. 

    The trading price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering in November 1999. The stock market, in general, and the Nasdaq National Market and stocks of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility is often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class-action litigation has often been initiated against these companies. This litigation, if initiated, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which would significantly harm our business.
