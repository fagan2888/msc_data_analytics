ITEM 1. BUSINESS 


Overview 

        QuickLogic Corporation develops, markets and supports advanced Field Programmable Gate Array, or FPGA, and Embedded Standard Product, or ESP, semiconductors and the software tools that enable design engineers to use our products. We introduced ESPs, a new class of semiconductor devices, in 1998, to address the design community's demand for a solution that provides a powerful alternative to the existing options: Application Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICs, and the long-sought-after system-on-a-chip products. Specifically, our ESP devices provide engineers with the ease-of-use, guaranteed functionality and high performance of standard products, such as ASICs, combined with the flexibility of programmable logic. Our ESP and FPGA products target complex, high-performance systems in rapidly changing markets where system manufacturers seek to minimize time-to-market and maximize product differentiation and functionality. We compete in various markets, including: high-performance computing; instrumentation and test; data communications and telecommunications; video/audio and graphics imaging; and military and aerospace systems. 

        In August 2001, we acquired certain assets of V3 Semiconductor, Inc., a manufacturer of application specific standard products, or ASSPs. The acquisition of V3 provided us with an ASSP design center in Canada and with ASSP products that complement our ESP products. 

        QuickLogic was incorporated in California in 1988 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1999. Our headquarters are located at 1277 Orleans Drive, Sunnyvale, California 94089. We can be reached at (408) 990-4000, and our website address is www.quicklogic.com. 

Product Technology 

        The key components of our ESP and FPGA product families are our ViaLink® programmable metal technology, our user-programmable platform and the associated software tools used for system design. Our ViaLink technology allows us to create devices smaller than competitors' comparable products, thereby minimizing silicon area and cost. In addition, our ViaLink technology has lower electrical resistance and capacitance than other programmable technologies and, consequently, supports higher signal-speed and low power consumption. Our user-programmable platform facilitates full utilization of a device's logic cells, clocks and Input/Output pins. These logic cells have been optimized to efficiently implement a wide range of logic functions at high speed, thereby enabling greater usable device density and design flexibility. Our architecture uses our ViaLink technology to maximize interconnects at every routing wire intersection. The abundance of interconnect resources allows more paths between logic cells. As a consequence, system designers are able to use QuickLogic devices with smaller gate counts than competing FPGAs to implement their designs. These smaller gate-count devices require less silicon area and as a result are able to be offered at a lower price. ViaLink offers intellectual property security to our customers, since it is difficult to reverse engineer intellectual property that is implemented using our one-time-programmable ViaLink technology. Finally, our software enables our customers to efficiently implement their designs using our products.

Industry Background 

        Competitive pressures are forcing manufacturers of electronic systems to rapidly bring to market products with improved functionality, higher performance and greater reliability, all at lower cost. Providers of systems requiring high-speed data transmission and processing such as computing equipment, storage sub-systems, instrumentation and test equipment, communications equipment, and digital image products face intense time-to-market pressures. These market forces have driven the evolution of logic semiconductors, which are used in complex electronic systems to coordinate the functions of other semiconductors, such as microprocessors or memory. There are three types of advanced logic semiconductors: 

•
Application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, are special purpose devices designed for a particular manufacturer's electronic system. These devices are customized during wafer manufacturing; 


•
Application specific standard products, or ASSPs, are fixed-function devices designed to comply with industry standards that can be used by a variety of electronic systems manufacturers. Their functions are fixed prior to wafer fabrication; and 


•
Programmable logic devices, or PLDs, are general-purpose devices, which can be used by a variety of electronic systems manufacturers, and are customized after purchase for a specific application. Field programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, are types of PLDs used for complex functions. 
        Systems manufacturers have relied heavily on ASICs to implement the advanced logic required for their products. ASICs provide high performance due to customized circuit design. However, because ASICs are design-specific devices, they require long development and manufacturing cycles, delaying product introductions. In addition, because of the expense associated with the design of ASICs, they are cost effective only if they can be manufactured in high volumes. Finally, once ASICs are manufactured, their functionality cannot typically be changed to respond to evolving market demands. 

        ASSPs have become widely utilized, as industry standards have developed to address increasing system complexity and the need for communication between systems and system components. These standards include: 

•
Peripheral component interconnect, or PCI, a standard developed to provide a high performance, reliable and cost-effective method of connecting high-speed devices within a system; 


•
Synchronous optical network, or SONET, a fiber-optic transmission standard for high-speed digital traffic, employed mainly by telephone companies and other network service providers; 


•
Ethernet, a widely-used local area network, or LAN, transport standard which controls the interconnection between servers and computers; and 


•
Fibre channel interconnect protocol, an industry-networking standard for storage area networks, or SANs, which controls the interconnection between servers and storage devices. 
        Compared to ASICs, ASSPs offer the systems designer shorter development time, proven functionality, lower risk and reduced development cost. However, ASSPs generally cannot be used by systems manufacturers to differentiate their products. To address markets where industry standards do not exist or are changing and time-to-market is important, PLDs are often used. These products provide systems manufacturers with the flexibility to customize and thereby differentiate their systems, unlike ASSPs. PLDs also enable systems manufacturers to change the logic functionality of their systems after product introduction without the expense and time of redesigning an ASIC. However, most PLDs are more expensive than ASSPs and even ASICs of equivalent functionality because they 

3


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


require more silicon area. In addition, most PLDs offer lower performance than non-programmable solutions, such as ASSPs and ASICs. 

Industry Future: System-on-a-Chip 

        Over the past few years, semiconductor manufacturers have migrated to smaller process geometries. These smaller process geometries enable more logic elements to be incorporated in a single chip using less silicon area. More recently, advances have been made in the integration of logic and memory on a single chip, which had been difficult previously due to incompatible process technologies. The industry "holy grail" is to have the three basic components of electronic circuit boards; logic, memory and a microprocessor, on the same chip. Advantages of the single-chip approach to systems manufacturers include: 

•
simplified system development; 


•
reduced time-to-market; 


•
elimination of delays associated with the transfer of data between chips; 


•
smaller physical size; 


•
lower power dissipation; 


•
greater reliability; and 


•
lower cost. 
        However, as levels of logic integration have increased, devices have become more specific to a particular application. This fact limits their use and potential customer base. At this point in time, the potential of system-on-a-chip is compelling. However, the benefits of higher performance, low form factors, and low unit costs are quickly offset by high non-recurring engineering charges, expensive development and tool costs, long development cycles, and issues associated with intellectual property. Instead of banking on a risky system-on-a-chip alternative, many designers rely on traditional FPGA or ASIC solutions. This approach often requires using large, expensive devices—or even multiple devices—and typically requires extensive development time to implement. 

QuickLogic's ESP Solution 

        QuickLogic has leveraged its unique ViaLink technology and user-programmable platform to address the limitations inherent in current system-on-a-chip approaches. The result is Embedded Standard Products, or ESPs, that deliver the advantages offered by both FPGAs and ASSPs. In its simplest form, an ESP contains three basic parts: a programmable logic array, an embedded standard function, and a flexible interface that allows communication between the standard function and programmable logic array. Our ESP products combine the system-level functionality of ASSPs with the flexibility of FPGAs. We believe ESPs offer the following specific advantages: 

•
Increased Performance. In a typical design, data must travel between an ASSP and an FPGA across a printed circuit board. The limited number of connections available and the distance between the devices can degrade the system's overall performance. Our ESP solution allows all data to be processed on a single chip; 


•
Decreased Cost. Because our ESP is a single chip solution, it requires less silicon area, and therefore is less expensive to produce. Additionally, this single chip approach lowers the component, assembly and test cost for the system manufacturer; 


•
Increased Reliability. ESP designs are more reliable because single chip solutions contain fewer components and circuit board connections that are subject to failure; and 
4


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•
Shorter Development Time. With a multiple chip design, systems designers must solve complex routing and timing issues between devices. A single chip ESP provides an "out-of-the-box" solution to the timing issues between devices and simplifies software simulation, leading to shorter development time. 
        QuickLogic's QuickMIPS family was introduced in 2001. This product is truly a "programmable system-on-a-chip" and best represents the benefits that designers can realize using our ESP technology. The current product development cycle is generally sequential—hardware is developed first, followed by software, and finally system integration and testing. If the systems architect (who typically manages all these functions) needs to make hardware/software trade-offs, a prototype board must be developed. This can extend development time and increase costs. Designers using QuickMIPS can develop software and hardware in parallel—cutting development time and reducing total cost of ownership. 

        The QuickMIPS family is a complete solution. All elements needed to develop an electronics system are included—a device (which contains flexible programmable logic and a high-performance MIPS processor core), a prototype or development board, a complete set of development tools, and popular features (buses, ethernet MACs, PCI, UARTs, etc.) that enable the QuickMIPS device to communicate with other components on the board. Finally, because these devices are based on our ViaLink technology, the design is secure and therefore the design investment is secure as well. 

        Many of today's embedded electronic systems require peripheral component interconnect, or PCI, bridging capabilities. Often large and complex, these designs can require the developer to become a PCI "expert" in real time—time that is often not available. QuickLogic's QuickPCI family provides a range of PCI bridging solutions, all of which are based on our ViaLink technology. Because our QuickPCI products are complete solutions—they include a device, comprehensive software and hardware development kits, and a variety of development services—they allow the PCI interface to be implemented quickly and easily. Therefore, the designer spends less time architecting the PCI interface and the resulting production cycle is shorter. In addition, the designer can focus on adding value to the end product by using his or her expertise on other areas of the design. 

        Our QuickRAM family serves applications that require embedded memory. Our ESP families are designed for performance-driven applications. QuickLogic has introduced several other ESP products. ESP development efforts during 2002 were focused on expanding our PCI product line and designing QuickMIPS products using advanced wafer manufacturing technology. 

QuickLogic's FPGA Solution 

        QuickLogic's FPGAs offer high performance at low power and competitive pricing when compared to alternative FPGA solutions, in addition to offering the advantages typically associated with FPGAs. Specifically, our products provide greater design flexibility than standard FPGAs and enable designers of complex systems to achieve rapid time-to-market with highly differentiated products. Our products are based on our ViaLink technology and user-programmable platform, and our associated QuickWorks and QuickTools design software. 

        During 2000, we introduced a new FPGA family called Eclipse—devices that offer a host of new system-level features that are ideal for computing and test, telecommunications and networking applications that require a combination of high-performance, high density and embedded random access memory, or RAM. In addition, we continue to sell our three families of pASIC FPGAs. FPGA development efforts during 2002 were focused on developing an advanced wafer manufacturing technology, which will allow us to expand our product lines and offer higher value to our customers.

The QuickLogic Strategy 

        Our objective is to be the indispensable provider of high-speed, flexible, cost-effective ESPs—products that integrate standard functions and programmable logic. We believe ESPs offer systems manufacturers the ability to accelerate design cycles to satisfy demanding time-to-market requirements while reducing their total cost of ownership. To achieve our objective, we have adopted the following strategies: 

Extend Technology Leadership 

        Our ViaLink technology, FPGA architecture, ASSP design capabilities, user-programmable platform and proprietary software design tools enable us to offer flexible, high-performance ESP products. We intend to continue to invest in the development of these technologies and to utilize such developments in future innovations of our ESP products. We also intend to focus engineering resources on developing systems-level ESP solutions. We target applications that benefit from the flexibility of programmable logic, including: 

•
programmable system-on-a-chip applications; 


•
interconnect applications such as PCI bridging; 


•
low power, volume applications typically reserved for ASICs; and 


•
applications that are difficult or expensive to implement in traditional FPGAs. 


        Specifically, we intend to focus our design and marketing efforts on systems manufacturers who sell complex systems within our target market segments. These include: 

•
high-performance computing; 


•
instrumentation and test; 


•
data communications and telecommunications; 


•
video/audio and graphics and imaging; and 


•
military and aerospace systems. 
Provide Complete System Solutions 

        Our focus on a more targeted set of applications and market segments allows us to provide value-added solutions to systems manufacturers. These solutions include not only the device and design software, but also software drivers, reference designs, test boards and complementary intellectual property functions. We currently focus ESP development efforts on two strategic applications areas: 

•
embedded high-performance processing solutions; and 


•
embedded PCI bridging solutions. 
Strategic Alliances 

        As a part of our ESP strategy, we have engaged with MIPS Technologies, Tower Semiconductor, Aeroflex UTMC Microelectronics Systems, Inc., and other companies to expand the range of technology that we embed in our products. In addition, we continue to sell through a network of industry sales representatives and distributors. These alliances are an essential element of our ESP strategy and a source of competitive strength going forward. By leveraging the expertise of our partners in intellectual property development, wafer fabrication and sales, we can devote our effort to the development of targeted, well-defined ESP products.

Sales and Technical Support 

        We sell our products through a network of sales managers, independent sales representatives and electronics distributors in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition to our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, we have regional sales operations in Los Angeles, Dallas, Minneapolis, Boston, Raleigh, London, Munich, Shin-Yokohama, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Our sales personnel and independent sales representatives are responsible for sales and applications support for a given region of responsibility. Our sales managers and independent sales representatives generally focus on major strategic accounts. Our distributor partnerships generally focus on customers who are not directly served by our sales managers. 

        Currently in North America, our distributors include the Cilicon group of Avnet. Inc., and Future Electronics. A network of distributors throughout Europe and Asia supports our international business. These firms work with our regional sales managers in discovering new opportunities, satisfying customer needs, providing technical support and other value-added services. This activity takes place with new customers as well as existing customers. From time-to-time, we add or delete distributors and sales representatives, as appropriate to meet our needs. 

        We provide systems manufacturers with comprehensive technical support, which we believe is critical to remaining competitive in the markets we serve. Our factory-based and distributor applications support organizations provide pre-sales and on-site technical support to customers. 

Competition 

        The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by constant technological change, rapid rates of product obsolescence and price erosion. A number of companies offer products that compete with one or more of our products. Our existing competitors include suppliers of conventional standard products, such as PLX Technology; suppliers of complex programmable logic devices, or CPLDs, including Lattice Semiconductor and Altera; suppliers of FPGAs, particularly Xilinx and Actel; and suppliers of embedded processors, such as Integrated Device Technology and Motorola. Xilinx and Altera dominate the programmable logic market and have substantially greater revenue, market presence and financial resources, than Actel, Lattice or us. Xilinx dominates the FPGA segment of the market while Altera dominates the CPLD segment of the market. We also face competition from companies that offer gate arrays, which can be obtained at a lower cost for high volumes and may have gate densities and performance equal or superior to our products. As we introduce additional ESPs, we will also face competition from standard product manufacturers who are already servicing or who may decide to enter the markets addressed by these ESP devices. In addition, we expect significant competition in the future from major domestic and international semiconductor suppliers. We also may face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies. Increased competition is likely to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any one of which could seriously harm our business. 

        We believe that important competitive factors in our market are length of development cycle, price, performance, installed base of development systems, adaptability of products to specific applications, ease of use and functionality of development system software, reliability, technical service and support, wafer fabrication capacity and sources of raw materials, market presence, financial strength and protection of products by effective utilization of intellectual property laws. 

Research and Development 

        Our future success will depend to a large extent on our ability to rapidly develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products that meet emerging industry standards and satisfy changing customer requirements. We have made and expect to continue to make substantial

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


investments in research and development and to participate in the development of new and existing industry standards. 

        As of December 31, 2002, our research and development staff consisted of 57 employees working in three locations: Canada, India and Sunnyvale. The Canadian group specializes in system level issues, and has responsibility for the physical design of the ASSP portion of our ESP products, and for the operating system and tool flow support of our MIPS based products. The Indian group specializes in the EDA tools required to support the programmable fabric that is used in both our ESP products and our FPGA products. The Sunnyvale groups support the physical design of the programmable fabric-process, logic design, and programming—as well as developing mixed-signal blocks, and certain portions of the EDA tools required to support the programmable fabric. 

•
Our process engineering group develops our proprietary ViaLink wafer manufacturing process, oversees product manufacturing and process development with our third-party foundries, and is involved in ongoing process improvements to increase yields and optimize device characteristics. 


•
Our mixed-signal engineering group develops high-performance analog circuits to support our ESP products. 


•
Our FPGA design engineering group develops high-performance programmable systems that can be used stand-alone or combined with high value dedicated functions to form ESP products. 


•
Our ASSP design engineering group develops or integrates dedicated IP functions that are combined with a programmable system to produce ESP products. 


•
Our FPGA software group develops the design libraries, interface routines and place and route software that allows our customers to use third-party design environments to develop designs for our programmable systems and subsystems. 


•
Our embedded systems group develops the software required to program and use our MIPS based products. 
        Our research and development expenses for 2000, 2001 and 2002 were $9.3 million, $14.3 million and $13.1 million, respectively. The increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to increased ESP development activity. We anticipate that we will continue to commit substantial resources to research and development in the future. 

Manufacturing 

        We have established close relationships with third-party manufacturers for our wafer fabrication, package assembly, test and programming requirements in an effort to ensure stability in the supply of our products and minimize the risk of localized capacity constraints. 

        We currently outsource all of our wafer manufacturing to Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, at its Round Rock, Texas facility; to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, at its Taiwan facilities; and to Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. Cypress manufactures our pASIC1 and pASIC2 product families using a three-layer metal, 0.65 micron CMOS process on six-inch wafers. TSMC manufactures our pASIC3, QuickRAM and QuickPCI product families using a four-layer metal, 0.35 micron CMOS process. TSMC also manufactures our Eclipse and other ESP products using a five-layer metal, 0.25 micron process on eight-inch wafers. Samsung manufactures certain QuickPCI products. Our Cypress agreement provides a guaranteed capacity availability. We purchase products from TSMC and Samsung on a purchase order basis. 

        On December 12, 2000 we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement, a Foundry Agreement and other related agreements with Tower Semiconductor Ltd., under which we agreed to make a $25 million strategic investment in Tower as part of Tower's plan to build and equip a new wafer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


fabrication facility. The new fabrication facility is expected to produce 200-mm wafers in geometries of 0.18 micron and below, using advanced CMOS technology from Toshiba. Tower has agreed to develop manufacturing capability for our proprietary ViaLink technology, and supply us with a guaranteed portion of the new fabrication facility's available wafer capacity at competitive pricing, with first production expected in 2003. 

        We outsource our product packaging, test and programming to Amkor Technology and ChipPAC, Inc. at their South Korea facilities and to Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, or ASE, at its Taiwan facility, among others. 

Employees 

        As of December 31, 2002, we had a total of 157 employees worldwide, with 33 employees in operations, 57 employees in research and development, 22 employees in sales, 19 employees in marketing and 26 employees in administration. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. Since September 2002 we have significantly reduced our workforce to better align expenses with gross profit levels. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we believe our employee relations are favorable. 

Intellectual Property 

        Our future success and competitive position depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain the proprietary technology used in our principal products. We hold 90 U.S. patents and have 3 pending applications for additional U.S. patents containing claims covering various aspects of programmable integrated circuits, programmable interconnect structures and programmable metal devices. Additionally in Japan, we have two patent applications pending and three granted. In Europe, we have two patent applications pending and in Korea we have two patent applications pending. Our issued patents expire between 2009 and 2019. We have also registered seven trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 

        Because it is critical to our success that we are able to prevent competitors from copying our innovations, we intend to continue to seek patent protection for our products. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive, and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents, or that, even if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. Furthermore, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own. 

        We also rely on trade secret protection for our technology, in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. However, employees may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In any case, others may come to know about or determine our trade secrets through a variety of methods. In addition, the laws of certain territories in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. 

        From time to time, we receive letters alleging patent infringement or inviting us to take a license to other parties' patents. We evaluate these letters on a case-by-case basis. Offers such as these may lead to litigation if we reject the opportunity to obtain the license.
