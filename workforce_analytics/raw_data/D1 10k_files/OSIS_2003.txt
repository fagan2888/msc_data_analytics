ITEM 1.    BUSINESS    

 

General 

 

OSI Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (sometimes referred to as the “Company”) is a vertically integrated, worldwide provider of security and inspection systems, optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems, and medical monitoring and imaging products. 

 

We design, manufacture and market security and inspection systems worldwide to end users under the “Rapiscan,” “Secure,” “Ancore,” and “Metor” brand names. These products are used to inspect people, baggage, cargo, vehicles and other objects for weapons, explosives, drugs and other contraband. These systems are also used for the safe, accurate and efficient verification of cargo manifests for the purpose of assessing duties and monitoring the export and import of controlled materials. 

 

Our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems are used in a broad range of applications, including aerospace and defense electronics, security and inspection systems, medical diagnostics, fiber optics, telecommunications, gaming, office automation, computer peripherals and industrial automation. We design and manufacture optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems for others through OEM arrangements, as well as for our security and medical equipment businesses. 

 

In the medical field, we design, manufacture and market bone densitometers, which are used to provide bone density measurements in the diagnosis of osteoporosis, and to provide an early stage detection of potential development of osteoporosis. We also manufacture and sell arterial hemoglobin (“SpO2”) saturation monitors and sensors, including hand-held monitoring tools under the trade names “Dolphin ONE,” “Aristo,” and “Dolphin 2000”. 

 

In fiscal year 2003, revenues from the sale of security and inspection products amounted to $120.8 million, or approximately 66% of our revenues, while revenues from the sale of optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems and medical imaging and monitoring systems amounted to $61.8 million, or approximately 34% of our revenues. Further information concerning reporting segments is available in Note 14 to our financial statements. 

 

Industry Overview 

 

We sell our security and inspection products and medical monitoring and imaging systems primarily to end-users, while we design and manufacture our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems primarily for OEMs. 

 

Security and Inspection Products.    A variety of products are currently used worldwide in security and inspection applications. These products include single energy x-ray equipment, dual energy x-ray equipment, metal detectors, x-ray machines employing backscatter detection technology, and cargo inspection systems using x-rays, gamma rays or thermal neutron analysis. We believe that the market for security and inspection products will continue to be affected by the threat of terrorist incidents and by new government mandates and appropriations for security and inspection products in the United States and internationally. We also anticipate a growing market for the use of our products in non-security applications such as customs manifest verification and agricultural products inspection. 

 

In the 1970s, principally in response to civilian airline hijackings, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) established security standards by setting guidelines for the screening of carry-on baggage for weapons. The United Nations later mandated these standards for adoption by all of its member states. We believe that to date the imposition of these standards has resulted in the installation of over 10,000 x-ray inspection systems in

airports worldwide. Additionally, since 1998, the United Kingdom Department of Transport has required that the United Kingdom’s commercial airports deploy systems for 100% screening of international checked baggage. The European Civil Aviation Conference, an organization of 41 member states, has also agreed to implement 100% screening of international checked baggage in the future. 

 

In the United States, largely in response to the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 in December 1988, Congress enacted the Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990, which, among other initiatives, directed the FAA to establish and implement strict security measures and to deploy advanced technology for the detection of explosives. In July 1996, then-President Clinton formed the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security (the “Gore Commission”) to review airline and airport security and to oversee aviation safety. In response to the initial report released by the Gore Commission, the United States enacted legislation that included $144 million in appropriations for the initial deployment of advanced security and inspection technology at major U.S. airports. A portion of this funding was allocated for Threat Image Projection Ready X-ray systems at security checkpoints throughout the United States. 

 

In April 2000, the FAA awarded us a contract to provide x-ray screening systems at selected airports throughout the United States. Under the contract, the FAA has the right to purchase from us up to 800 systems, for which the aggregate purchase price would be approximately $40 million. In fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003 our install-base totaled approximately 500 systems under this contract. We received additional orders for more than 200 systems, some of which were shipped in fiscal 2003, and the balance of which will be shipped in fiscal 2004. 

 

The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon using hijacked airliners has led to nation-wide shifts in air and ground transportation security and facilities security policies. Since these attacks, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act and integrated many U.S. security-related agencies into the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. As a result of these and other changes, sales of our security and inspection products have grown as compared to pre-September 11, 2001 levels. 

 

Worldwide trends toward increased international trade and transportation of goods and people have resulted in a growing demand for cargo, port and border inspection technologies. We currently market our cargo, port and border inspection systems through Rapiscan’s Cargo Inspection Group. Projects recently installed or currently underway include system installations in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Romania, South Korea, Mexico and the United States. These sites contain various cargo product types including fixed and relocatable high-energy systems, mobile gamma-ray and x-ray detection systems, and hybrid x-ray/thermo neutron analysis scanning systems. We anticipate a growing demand from governments and commercial enterprises for increasingly sophisticated solutions to screening vehicles, trucks, ocean-going cargo, and air pallet containers. 

 

Optoelectronic Devices and Subsystems.    Our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems are used for a wide variety of applications ranging from complex monitoring, measurement or positioning functions, such as in industrial robotics where our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems are used to detect the exact position, motion or size of another object, to simple functions, such as the detection of paper in the print path of a laser printer. Because optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems can be used in a wide variety of measurement control and monitoring applications, they are used in a broad array of industrial applications and are key components in the telecommunications and fiber optics industries. 

 

We believe that in recent years, advances in technology and reductions in the cost of key components of optoelectronic systems, including computer processing power and memory, have broadened the market by enabling the use of optoelectronic devices in a greater number of applications. In addition, we see a trend among OEMs to increasingly outsource the design and manufacture of optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems to fully-integrated, independent manufacturers, like us, who may have greater specialization, broader expertise, and the flexibility to respond in shorter time periods than most OEMs can accomplish in-house. We believe that our level of vertical integration, substantial engineering resources, expertise in the use and

Table of Contents
application of optoelectronic technology, and low-cost international manufacturing operations enable us to compete effectively in the market for optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems. 

 

Through our subsidiary, RapiTec, Inc. (“RapiTec”), our optoelectronic devices and subsystems group has also penetrated the worldwide weapons simulation market. Through system engineering, product development, rapid prototyping, and volume manufacturing, RapiTec develops, manufactures and markets state-of-the-art, laser-based training systems for the defense industry. We recently added to these capabilities through the formation of a new subsidiary, OSI Defense Systems, LLC (“OSI Defense”). In August 2003, OSI Defense acquired the laser-based training systems business of Schwartz Electro-Optics, Inc. whose products include tactical engagement simulation systems, man worn laser detectors, small arms transmitters, controller guns and a variety of targeting systems. 

 

Our optoelectronic devices and subsystems group has also developed high-speed silicon photodiodes for use in fiber optic systems such as Gigabit Ethernet and Fiber Channel systems. These products can cost-effectively replace Gallium Arsenide products. We have developed a silicon-based fiber optic detector that can achieve a 2.5 gigabit/second data rate using 3.3 volts bias voltage. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, OSI Fibercomm, Inc., we have launched a family of Indium Gallium Arsenide photodetectors for use in a variety of network applications and long-haul communications applications, together with high-speed silicon-based detectors combined with transimpedence amplifiers. 

 

Medical Monitoring and Imaging Systems.    Our Company designs, manufactures and markets medical monitoring and imaging systems. We manufacture and distribute the DTX-200, a U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”)-approved forearm DEXA (Dual Energy X-Ray) densitometer, which is used to diagnose osteoporosis as well as to provide follow-up bone density measurements. We also manufacture and distribute the ultrasound DTU-One, a FDA-approved calcaneus ultrasound scanner. The DTU-One is the first commercially available ultrasound scanner using imaging capability for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. We recently also received 510(k) approval from the FDA to sell our new dual energy x-ray based tabletop bone densitometer, DexaCare G4. The DexaCare G4, which represents our latest generation densitometer, is also lighter and smaller than its predecessors. 

 

Our medical monitoring and imaging systems group also develops next-generation pulse oximetry instruments and compatible pulse oximetry sensors. It manufactures and distributes, under the Dolphin One product line, products incorporating a proprietary pulse oximetry technology that is used to non-invasively monitor oxygenation levels. Dolphin One products include the Voyager, the Dolphin 2100 and the Dolphin 2150. The Voyager is the first personal data assistant-based pulse oximetry product on the market. The Voyager and the Dolphin 2100 are FDA 510(k) approved. The Dolphin 2150 is pending FDA approval. Our medical monitoring and imaging systems group also manufactures and distributes, under the Dolphin 2000, Aristo and CopyCat product lines, sensors that are compatible with products made by other manufacturers of pulse oximetry technologies. 

 

Growth Strategy 

 

Our primary objectives are to be a leading provider of security and inspection products, specialized optoelectronic products, and cutting-edge medical monitoring and imaging systems, to enhance our position in the international inspection and detection marketplace, to leverage our expertise in the optoelectronic technology industry by entering into new markets, and to capitalize on our research to provide reliable and cost-optimized medical devices. Key elements of this strategy include: 

 

Capitalizing on the Growing Market for Security and Inspection Products.    We believe that heightened attentiveness to terrorist and other security threats may continue to drive growth in the market for security and inspection products, not only in transportation security, but in facilities security, event security and materials inspection as well. In addition, the trend toward increased international transportation of goods and people may result in growth in the market for cargo inspection systems. Package screening by freight forwarders also

represents a potential growing sector, as new regulations in Europe require such screening, and awareness of the need for such screening grows in the U.S. We intend to continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts both domestically and internationally, and to capitalize on opportunities to replace, service and upgrade existing security installations. 

 

Developing New Security and Inspection Technologies.    We intend to continue develop new security and inspection products such as our proprietary Pulsed Fast Neutron Analysis (“PFNA”) and Thermal Neutron Analysis (“TNA”) systems. The PFNA, TNA, and the other technological advances we make allow us to offer customers the broadest variety of advanced security solutions. In addition, through research and development and selective acquisitions, we may enhance and expand our current product offerings to better address new applications and security industry demands. 

 

Leveraging the Optoelectronic Design and Manufacturing Expertise to Address New Applications.    We think that one of our primary competitive strengths is our expertise in designing and manufacturing, at cost-effective rates, specialized optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems for our own end products and for the products of our OEM customers. Our optoelectronic devices and subsystems group currently designs and manufactures devices and subsystems for numerous customers serving hundreds of applications. 

 

Improving Existing Medical Diagnostic Technologies.    We continue to improve and develop medical diagnostic tools aimed at bone metabolic diseases, such as osteoporosis, and patient monitors and accessories with a particular emphasis on pulse oximetry and respiratory gas analysis. Our research within this field will continue to concentrate on the development of devices that make it possible for institutions from large hospitals to small clinics and physicians’ offices to obtain accurate, precise, reliable and cost-effective results. 

 

Acquiring New Companies and Technologies.    We have developed our expertise in this and other areas through internal research and development efforts and also through selective acquisitions. 

 

In 1987, we formed Opto Sensors (Singapore) PTE Ltd. (“OSI Singapore”) to manufacture optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems. 

 

In 1990, we acquired UDT Sensors, Inc. (“UDT Sensors”) to broaden our expertise and capabilities in developing and manufacturing optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems. 

 

In 1993, we acquired Rapiscan Security Products Limited (“Rapiscan U.K.”) and, through Rapiscan Security Products (U.S.A.), Inc. (“Rapiscan U.S.A.”) (Rapiscan U.S.A. and Rapiscan U.K. are sometimes collectively referred to as “Rapiscan”), commenced our operations as a provider of security and inspection products in the United States. 

 

Thereafter, in 1993, we acquired Ferson Optics, Inc. (“Ferson Optics”) for its passive optic technologies. Because of competitive market forces, primarily in Asia with significantly lower costs of labor, sales of Ferson Optic’s products show little opportunity of growth in the foreseeable future. We are actively monitoring this and have implemented cost-cutting measures. Ferson Optics is a small portion of our overall business. 

 

In 1994, we commenced operations of Opto Sensors (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. (“OSI Malaysia”) to take advantage of lower manufacturing costs in Malaysia. 

 

In 1997, we acquired Advanced Micro Electronics AS (“AME”) for AME’s hybrid optoelectronic capabilities. 

 

In 1998, we acquired Osteometer MediTech A/S (“Osteometer”), a Danish manufacturer of diagnostic scanners used for the early detection of symptoms of osteoporosis. However, due to the global decline in the bone densitometer market, in August 1999 we closed the operations of Osteometer in Denmark, and relocated

certain of those operations to our U.S. facilities. In the quarter ended September 30, 1999, we recorded estimated restructuring costs of $1.9 million related to the closure of the Osteometer facility in Denmark. Those costs were associated primarily with the termination of certain employees and commitments, and other facility closure costs. During the quarter ended March 31, 2000, we completed the closure of the Osteometer facility in Denmark and the relocation of the operations to the U.S. The market for osteoporosis diagnostic equipment is currently weak and is expected to remain so for at least the near-term. 

 

In 1998, we purchased the security products business of Metorex International Oy (“Metorex Security”) of Espoo, Finland. We paid $4.7 million in cash, including professional fees associated with the acquisition. In July 1999, we paid 4.4 million Finnish markka (approximately $739,000), in lieu of contingent payments of up to $1.5 million, based on future sales. The acquisition of Metorex Security brought a complete security metal detection product line to our security and inspection products group. Metor brand security archway metal detectors are among the most widely recognized such products in the world. These metal detectors complement the x-ray screening systems supplied by Rapiscan. Metorex Security continues to supply a large number of systems to the U.S. Government, as well as to customers around the world. The products include the Metor 100 series archways, the Metor 200 series zonal archways and the Metor 200Hde, which was recently certified by the Transportation Security Administration. Our MetorNet product allows monitoring and control of multi-system installations from a central workstation. 

 

In 1998, we acquired all the outstanding stock of Silicon Microstructures, Inc. (“SMI”), a silicon pressure-sensor manufacturer, from Exar Corporation of Fremont, California. We paid $2.7 million in cash, including professional fees associated with the acquisition. On March 31, 2001, we sold all of the outstanding stock of SMI to Elmos Semiconductor AG of Germany for $6 million in cash. In connection with this transaction, we sold certain capital equipment to SMI for $462,000 in cash. The sale also included a three-year commitment from us to supply four-inch silicon foundry wafers to SMI and to dedicate limited manufacturing facilities to be used by SMI for its etching operations, a commitment which would have terminated in March 2004. The total pre-tax gain on the transaction was approximately $3 million. In July 2002, SMI served a notice on us terminating the commitment. In January 2003, we negotiated a settlement agreement and, as of June 30, 2003, there were no further outstanding obligations. 

 

In 1998, we acquired most of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Corrigan Canada Ltd. (“Corrigan”), a Canadian security products manufacturer, for approximately $476,000 in cash, including professional fees associated with the acquisition. 

 

In 1998, we invested $315,000, including professional fees associated with the acquisition, in Square One, Inc. (“Square One”) for an equity share of approximately 16%. In August 2000, we acquired substantially all of Square One’s assets for consideration of $259,000 in cash, including professional fees associated with the acquisition, future royalties (on which a $30,000 advance payment was made), and return of the Square One stock held by us. The acquired business now develops and manufactures infrared-based patient monitoring medical subsystems for us under the Square One product line. 

 

In January 1999, we acquired Aristo Medical Products, Inc. (“Aristo”) for approximately $277,000 in cash, including professional fees associated with the acquisition. The acquired business now develops and manufactures next generation pulse oximeter probes for us under the Aristo product line. 

 

During fiscal 1999, we invested $1.0 million, including professional fees associated with the acquisition, in OSI Medical, Inc. (“OSI Medical”) for an equity share of approximately 40%. OSI Medical developed next generation pulse oximeter instruments and probes for use in the medical field. Pursuant to an agreement entered into in October 1999, we acquired an additional equity interest, representing approximately 16% of the stock ownership of OSI Medical for $1.2 million, including professional fees associated with the acquisition. During fiscal 2001, we acquired an additional equity interest representing approximately 19% of the ownership of OSI Medical for $282,000. With these additional equity investments, we increased our equity share in OSI Medical to approximately 75%.

Table of Contents
In April 2000, also pursuant to the OSI Medical Agreement and in connection with certain amounts loaned or to be loaned by us to OSI Medical thereunder, we acquired five-year warrants (subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain events) to acquire up to 1,110,000 additional OSI Medical shares at a purchase price of $1.35 per share. 

 

In September 2001, the medical device business of our optoelectronic devices and subsystem group was contributed to a newly formed subsidiary named Dolphin Medical, Inc. (“Dolphin Medical”), for the purpose of consolidating our various medical devices into a single subsidiary. We merged OSI Medical into Dolphin Medical in March 2002. We now own approximately 93.7% of Dolphin Medical. 

 

In July 2002, we acquired substantially all the assets of Thermo Centro Vision, Inc., an optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems designer and manufacturer based in Ventura County, California, for a purchase price of $1.45 million. The acquisition was made through a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, Centro Vision, Inc. Although our agreement to purchase the assets and business of Thermo Centro Vision, Inc. included a provision for a contingent additional payment based on the financial performance of the business measured as of December 31, 2002, the minimum threshold for the contingent additional payment was not met. We are therefore under no further obligation to make additional purchase price payments in this transaction. 

 

In July 2002, we purchased from Imagis Technologies, Inc. (“Imagis”) 1,166,667 shares of its common stock (approximately 6% of its outstanding stock), 2-year warrants to purchase 291,667 additional shares of Imagis common stock (approximately 1.5% of its then-outstanding stock) at a price of $1.50 per share, and certain ancillary rights for an aggregate purchase price of $1.75 million. Imagis develops facial recognition software for security applications. We have designated the investment as available for sale. The investment, adjusted for changes in the market value of Imagis’ equity securities, is included under other assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. For the year ended June 30, 2003, based on the continued trading of Imagis common stock below the original purchase price for a prolonged period of time, we recognized an other than temporary impairment in the market value of this investment as of June 30, 2003 and recognized a pre-tax charge of $1.4 million in our income statement. 

 

In August 2002, we invested $775,000 to purchase a minority equity interest in an overseas research and development venture focused on security technologies. In August 2003, we invested $1,100,000 in the form of a loan convertible into the company’s equity. In addition we were issued a warrant by the venture which is exercisable for a number of shares equal to 25% of the number of shares that any unconverted portion of the loan would have been converted into had it been converted. As a result of adopting FIN 46 (consolidation of variable interest entities), we will begin consolidating this venture, which is currently accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 

 

In November 2002, we acquired all the outstanding capital stock of Ancore, a Santa Clara, California based privately held high-technology developer and provider of advanced inspection systems for aviation security, port and border inspection and counter-terrorism. Consideration paid for the acquisition consisted of a combination of OSI Common Stock and cash. At the close of the acquisition, we paid $2 million in cash, and issued 347,890 shares of OSI Common Stock valued at $5.8 million. The acquisition agreement contains certain provisions for additional contingent purchase price payments. 

 

Based on such provisions, in January 2003, we made an additional cash payment of $2 million to former Ancore stockholders based on Ancore meeting certain performance criteria. In May 2003, an additional amount of approximately $574,000 was paid to former Ancore stockholders, based on Ancore meeting certain performance criteria. During the next five years, upon each commercial sale of a Pulsed Fast Neutron Analysis (“PFNA”) inspection system, we will pay former Ancore stockholders an earn-out of 6% of the price of the PFNA system, up to $750,000 per system, in either cash or stock, at our election. The PFNA earn-outs are capped at an aggregate of $34 million. PFNA Systems are currently in development under government funding, and there is no assurance that PFNA systems will be successfully commercialized.

Table of Contents
On December 9, 2002, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register the shares issued as part of the Ancore purchase consideration, as well as shares potentially issuable in satisfaction of contingent payments. The registration statement was declared effective as of December 16, 2002. 

 

In August 2003, we acquired the military, laser-based training business of Schwartz Electro-Optics, Inc. At the close of the transaction we paid approximately $3.8 million including professional fees associated with the acquisition. The acquisition was made through a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, OSI Defense Systems, LLC. The acquired business develops and manufactures tactical engagement simulation systems, man worn laser detectors, small arms transmitters, controller guns and a variety of targeting systems for the defense industry. 

 

Capitalizing on Vertical Integration.    Our vertical integration provides several advantages in both our optoelectronic devices and subsystems and security and detection product lines. These advantages include reduced manufacturing and delivery times, lower costs due to our access to competitive international labor markets, direct sourcing of raw materials and quality control. We also believe that we offer significant added value to our OEM customers by providing a full range of vertically-integrated services including component design and customization, subsystem concept design and application engineering, product prototyping and development, efficient pre-production, and short-run and high volume manufacturing. We believe that our vertical integration differentiates us from many of our competitors and provides value to our OEM customers who can rely on us to be an integrated supplier of optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems. We intend to continue to leverage our vertically integrated services to create greater value for our customers in the design and manufacture of our products. We believe that this strategy better positions us for penetration into other end markets. 

 

Capitalizing on Global Presence.    We operate from locations in North America, Europe and Asia. We view our international operations as providing an important strategic advantage over competitors in both the optoelectronic device and subsystem market and the security and inspection market for three primary reasons. First, international manufacturing facilities allow us to take advantage of competitive labor rates in order to be a low cost producer. Second, our international offices strengthen our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to service and repair our systems by providing direct access to growing foreign markets and to our existing international customer base. Third, multiple manufacturing locations allow us to reduce delivery times to our global customer base. In the future, we intend to develop new sources of manufacturing and sales capabilities to maintain and enhance the benefits of our international presence. 

 

Selectively Entering New Markets.    We intend to selectively enter new markets that complement our existing capabilities in the design, development and manufacture of optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems. We believe that by manufacturing other end products that rely on our existing technological capabilities, we will leverage our integrated design and manufacturing infrastructure to capture greater margins and to build a larger presence in those new end markets that present attractive competitive dynamics. We intend to achieve this strategy through internal growth and through selective acquisitions of end-product manufacturers. 

 

Products and Technology 

 

We design, develop, manufacture and sell products ranging from complex x-ray security and inspection products, to medical imaging and monitoring systems to discrete devices and value-added subsystems. 

 

Security and Inspection Equipment.    We manufacture and sell a range of security and inspection equipment that we market under the “Rapiscan,” “Secure,” “Ancore,” and “Metor” brand names. Traditionally, the primary market for these products was in aviation security. In recent years, and especially after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, security and inspection products have increasingly been used at a wide range of facilities other than airports. Moreover, the non-security use of such equipment, such as manifest verification by customs agencies at border crossings, or agricultural products inspection, has also grown. As a result of the 

 

7 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table of Contents
additional markets, we have successfully diversified sales channels for our security and inspection products. Of our security and inspection revenues, the percentage derived from the sale of inspection products to airlines and airports was approximately 28.3% in fiscal year 2001, 24.5% in fiscal year 2002 and 28.8% in fiscal year 2003, and the balance of such revenues were derived from all other sales. 

 

Many of our inspection and detection products combine the use of x-ray technology with our optoelectronic capabilities. Our products include dual- or multi-energy x-ray technology with computer enhanced imaging technology to facilitate the detection of materials such as explosives, narcotics, currency or other contraband. While all x-ray systems produce a two-dimensional image of the contents of the inspected material, the dual-energy x-ray systems also measure the x-ray absorption of the inspected materials’ contents at two x-ray energies to determine the atomic number, mass and other characteristics of the object’s contents. The various organic and non-organic substances in the inspected material appear to operators of the inspection systems in various colors and this visual information can be used to identify and differentiate the inspected materials. These inspection systems range in size from compact tabletop systems to large cargo, port and border inspection systems comprising entire buildings through which trucks, shipping containers or pallets are transported. 

 

Some of our inspection products require an operator to monitor the images produced by the inspection equipment. Depending on the model, our products permit the operator to inspect the contents of packages at varying image modes and magnifications. The images range from the monochrome and pseudo-color images produced by single energy x-ray imaging systems, to high resolution, multi-color images produced by our computer enhanced dual-energy models. We believe that our Rapiscan 500 Series machines provide one of the highest quality images currently available in the x-ray security and inspection industry. 

 

In order to monitor the performance of operators of the x-ray baggage screening systems that are used in United States airports, the FAA has implemented a computer-based training and evaluation program known as the Screener Proficiency Evaluation And Reporting System (“SPEARS”). To continuously monitor the effectiveness of the screening system and its operator, simulated threat images, such as weapons, are projected into the images of actual parcels being inspected. The results of these tests are available to government agencies. In relation to this effort, in April 2000, the FAA awarded us a contract for the purchase of up to 800 x-ray systems, for which the purchase price would be approximately $40 million. In fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, our install base grew to approximately 500 systems under this contract. We hold an additional order for more than 200 systems, some of which were shipped in fiscal 2003, and the balance will be shipped in fiscal 2004. 

 

We also manufacture inspection products that automatically and non-invasively detect explosives through the use of pulsed fast neutron and thermal neutron technologies. Such technologies permit the operator to inspect cargo, vehicles, and small parcels based on the distinctive chemical composition of various explosives. Our Pulsed Fast Neutron Analysis (“PFNA”) systems use a penetrating beam of fast neutrons to measure the elemental contents (oxygen, nitrogen, etc.) within scanned objects (cargo containers, trucks, etc.) and automatically identify explosives, drugs or other contraband based on elemental signatures. The PFNA system then displays to the system operator a three-dimensional image of the scanned object, identifying the location and type of contraband found. Our Thermal Neutron Analysis (“TNA”) systems detect bulk quantities of explosives and drugs concealed in trucks or cargo containers. During the inspection process, our TNA system bathes the inspected object in neutrons and the result of their interactions is strong and unique gamma ray signals, which the TNA system then analyzes to determine the presence of explosives or drugs automatically without operator intervention. 

 

With the acquisition of Metorex Security, we acquired a line of walk-through metal detection systems, which utilize pulse induced magnetic fields combined with microprocessor based electronics, which provide uniform detection of ferrous and non-ferrous metallic objects. The technologies range from dual-channel crossed magnetic fields to multi-zone coil configuration.

Table of Contents
Our “Secure” brand product line uses x-ray systems employing backscatter detection technology. The Secure 1000 is an electronic screening system for hands-off personal scanning. The system is based on an extremely low dose backscatter x-ray imaging to detect contraband and weapons concealed underneath clothing and hair. The system provides better screening than metal detectors as it displays anomalies caused by very small amounts of metal as well as non-metallic items. 

 

We also develop and market security and inspection systems for cargo, port and border applications using x-ray, neutron or gamma ray technology and computer-enhanced imaging. Such cargo systems are primarily used to verify the contents of trucks or cargo containers, and to detect the presence of any contraband. Cargo systems offer significant improvements over past methods of cargo screening, such as manual searches, as cargo systems are faster, more thorough, and do not subject the cargo to pilferage. Entire shipping containers or trucks can be screened in a few minutes. Our cargo systems currently include fixed site systems, relocatable systems, and mobile systems. 

 

Fixed-site systems consist of a permanent structure in which trucks or containers are subjected to high-energy x-ray, gamma-ray, or neutron inspection. Fixed site projects installed or currently under construction include systems in Australia, Hong Kong, Mexico, and Taiwan. Relocatable systems use similar technologies, but consist of structures that can be relocated among pre-positioned pads. Three relocatable systems were recently delivered to the Korean Customs Service. Mobile systems are truck-mounted systems using x-ray or gamma-ray sources for the inspection of vehicles or cargo containers. The mobile systems can be quickly deployed wherever needed. Mobile systems have been sold or are currently under production for customers including government agencies in the United States, Malaysia, and Romania.

Optoelectronic Devices and Subsystems.    Optoelectronic devices generally consist of both active and passive components. Active components sense light of varying wavelengths and convert the light detected into electronic signals, whereas passive components amplify, separate or reflect light. The active components we manufacture consist of silicon, Gallium Arsenide, and Indium Gallium Arsenide photodetectors. Passive components include lenses, prisms, filters, mirrors and other precision optical products that are used by us in the manufacture of our optoelectronic products or are sold to others for use in telescopes, laser printers, copiers, microscopes and other detection and vision equipment. 

 

The devices we manufacture are both standard products and products customized for specific applications and are offered either as components or as subsystems. 

 

In addition to the manufacture of standard and OEM products, we also specialize in designing and manufacturing customized optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems for use in a wide range of products and equipment. An optoelectronic subsystem typically consists of one or more optoelectronic devices

that are combined with other electronic components and packaging for use in an end product. The composition of a subsystem can range from a simple assembly of various optoelectronic devices that are incorporated into other subsystems (for example, a printed circuit board containing our optoelectronic devices) to complete end-products (for example, medical pulse oximeter probes that we manufacture and package on behalf of an OEM customer and then ship directly to the customer or the customer’s distributors). We manufacture subsystems for a variety of applications, such as fiber optics, imaging electronics for medical CT scanners, disposable and reusable medical probes for use with medical pulse oximetry equipment, components and subsystems for laser gyroscopes used in military and commercial aviation, optoelectronic subsystems for slot machines, laser subsystems in military helicopter gun sighting equipment, positioning subassemblies for computer peripheral equipment, alignment subsystems for laser heads in optical disc drives, and detection subsystems for submarines. 

 

We have recently developed two-dimensional back-illuminated detector technology for security, medical, and other industrial applications. This technology overcomes the limitations of conventional detectors by providing finer detector pitch density. We expect that this technology will be used in high-resolution multi-slice CT scanners and other applications requiring improved image resolution. 

 

Medical Monitoring and Imaging Systems.    Our Company designs, manufactures and markets medical monitoring and imaging systems. We manufacture and distribute the DTX-200, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)-approved Dual Energy X-Ray (“DEXA”) forearm densitometer, which is used to diagnose osteoporosis as well as to provide follow-up bone density measurements. We also manufacture and distribute the ultrasound DTU-One, a FDA-approved calcaneus ultrasound scanner. The DTU-One is the first commercially available ultrasound scanner using imaging capability for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Our DexaCare G4, dual energy x-ray based tabletop bone densitometer, is also FDA 510(k) approved. 

 

Our medical monitoring and imaging systems group also develops next-generation pulse oximetry instruments and compatible pulse oximetry sensors. It manufactures and distributes, under the Dolphin One product line, products incorporating a proprietary pulse oximetry technology that is used to non-invasively monitor oxygenation levels. Dolphin One products include the Voyager, the Dolphin 2100 and the Dolphin 2150. The Voyager is the first personal data assistant-based pulse oximetry product on the market. The Voyager and the Dolphin 2100 are FDA 510(k) approved. The Dolphin 2150 is pending FDA approval. Our medical monitoring and imaging systems group also manufactures and distributes, under the Dolphin 2000, Aristo and CopyCat product lines, sensors that are compatible with products made by other manufacturers of pulse oximetry technologies.

The market for most security and inspection products developed in response to civilian airline hijackings. Consequently, a significant portion of our security and inspection products was sold and continues to be sold for use at airports. Recently, however, our security and inspection products have been used for security purposes at locations in addition to airports, such as courthouses, office buildings, mailrooms, schools, prisons and high-profile locations such as Buckingham Palace, the Kremlin and the Vatican. In addition, our security and inspection products are increasingly being used for non-security purposes, such as for cargo inspection to detect narcotics and contraband and to verify manifests, prevention of pilferage at semiconductor manufacturing facilities, quality assurance, and the detection of gold and currency. The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon using hijacked airliners likely will continue to cause increasing levels of airport security measures, which have resulted in an increase in sales of our security and inspection products. 

 

In September 1998, we entered into an agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration for advanced contraband detection systems with threat image projection (“TIP”) features. The systems began to ship to Category X airports (designated due to their high security priority) in the United States during fiscal 1999. Systems were shipped during fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 and will continue to be shipped during fiscal 2004. In addition, the Transportation Security Administration ordered Rapiscan shoe scanning x-ray technology to supplement airport checkpoint screening.

In March 1999, we were awarded a contract by BAA plc, the operator of 11 airports around the world, including London’s Heathrow Airport, the busiest international airport in the world. Rapiscan U.K. has supplied, installed and will continue to maintain approximately 150 x-ray systems used in screening cabin baggage for explosives, weapons and other contraband in the U.K. and Scotland. These systems feature advanced detection software, including TIP. The agreement also provides for Rapiscan U.K. to provide maintenance and support services on the installed systems for five years. 

 

In April 2000, the FAA awarded us a contract to provide x-ray screening systems at selected airports throughout the United States. Under the contract, the FAA has the right to purchase up to 800 systems, for which the aggregate purchase price would be approximately $40 million. In fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003 our install base totaled approximately 500 systems under this contract. We hold an additional order for more than 200 systems, some of which were shipped in fiscal 2003, and the balance will be shipped in fiscal 2004. 

 

During fiscal year 2003 we received orders from Invision Technologies, Inc. to manufacture pre-scanners and related electronics for Invision’s CTX products. Shipments from these orders amounted to approximately $22 million. Sales to Invision are not expected to be material in fiscal year 2004. 

 

During fiscal year 2003, we completed the delivery of fixed site, relocatable, or mobile cargo inspection systems to governments and government agencies in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Romania, South Korea, and Taiwan. Revenues from these projects amounted to approximately $27 million in fiscal year 2003. 

 

Optoelectronic Devices and Subsystems.    Our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems are used in a broad range of products by a variety of customers. The following table illustrates, for the year ended June 30, 2003: (i) the major product categories for which we provided optoelectronic products, and (ii) certain representative customers in each category. We expect that the list of product categories, the amount of business derived from each such product category, and the composition of our major customers will vary from period to period.

Marketing, Sales and Service 

 

We market and sell our security and inspection products worldwide through a direct sales and marketing staff of approximately 55 employees located in the United States, Canada, Finland, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, in addition to a global network of independent sales representatives. We market and sell our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems, and medical imaging and monitoring systems worldwide through both a direct sales and marketing staff of approximately 30 employees and indirectly through a global network of independent sales representatives and distributors. Most of our in-house sales staff is based in the United States while most of our independent sales representatives and distributors are located abroad. 

 

Our optoelectronic products and medical imaging and monitoring systems sales staff, located in the United States, Singapore, Malaysia and Norway, is supported by an applications engineering group whose members are available to provide technical support. This support includes designing applications, providing custom tooling and process integration, defining solutions for customers and developing products that meet customer defined specifications. The security and inspection products sales staff is supported by a service organization of approximately 65 persons located primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, Finland and Malaysia, and a global network of independent service distributors. We also support these sales and customer relations efforts by providing operator training, computerized training and testing equipment, in-country service, software upgrades, service training for customer technicians and a newsletter on security issues. 

 

We consider our maintenance service operations to be an important element of our business. After the expiration of our standard product warranty periods, we are sometimes engaged by our customers to provide maintenance services for our security and inspection products through annual maintenance contracts. We believe that our international maintenance service capabilities allow us to be competitive in selling our security and inspection products. Furthermore, we believe that as our installed base of security and inspection products increases, revenues generated from such annual maintenance service contracts and from the sale of replacement parts will increase. 

 

Research and Development 

 

Our security and inspection products are designed at our facilities in Hawthorne and Santa Clara, California and internationally in Finland, Malaysia, India and the United Kingdom. These products include mechanical, electrical, electronic, digital electronic and software subsystems, which are all designed by us. In addition to product design, we provide system integration services to integrate our products into turnkey systems at the customer site. We support cooperative research projects with government agencies and, on occasion, provide contract research for our customers and government agencies.

Table of Contents
Our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems are primarily designed and engineered at our facilities in Hawthorne and Walnut, California, and Ocean Springs, Mississippi and internationally in India, Malaysia, and Norway. We engineer and manufacture subsystems to solve the specific application needs of our OEM customers. In addition, we offer entire subsystem design and manufacturing solutions. We consider our engineering personnel to be an important extension of our core sales and marketing efforts. 

 

Our medical diagnostic and imaging systems are designed and engineered at our facilities in Hawthorne, California. These systems include mechanical, electrical, digital electronic and software subsystems, all of which are designed by us. We are also currently involved, both in the U.S. and abroad, in several research projects aimed at improving our medical diagnostic and imaging systems and at expanding our current product line. 

 

In addition to close collaboration with our customers in the design and development of our current products, we maintain an active program for the development and introduction of new products, enhancements and improvements to our existing products, including the implementation of new applications of our technology. We seek to further enhance our research and development program and consider such program to be an important element of our business and operations. As of June 30, 2003, in addition to the engineers that we employed in manufacturing, process design and applications development, we engaged approximately 105 full-time engineers, technicians and support staff in research and development. During fiscal 2001, our research and development expenses were approximately $6.7 million, in 2002 they were $6.4 million and in 2003 they were $8.9 million. The decrease from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to certain research and development personnel working on specific shipments and the cost of their services was charged to manufacturing overhead and was also offset in part by increased research and development spending on security and inspection products. The increase in 2003 reflects increased expenditures in the security business as well as the expenditures incurred in our subsidiaries Ancore and Centrovision, which were acquired during the year. In order to fulfill our strategy of increasing our security and inspection product lines and of enhancing the capabilities of our existing products, we intend to continue to increase our research and development efforts in the future. 

 

Manufacturing and Materials Management 

 

We currently have manufacturing facilities for our security products in Hawthorne and Santa Clara, California and internationally in Canada, Finland, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. We have manufacturing facilities for our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems in Hawthorne, Newbury Park, and Walnut, California and Ocean Springs, Mississippi and internationally in Malaysia, Singapore, and Norway. We have manufacturing facilities for our medical products in Hawthorne, California and internationally in India, Malaysia, and Singapore. Our principal manufacturing facility is in Hawthorne, California. However, most of our high volume, labor intensive manufacturing and assembly is generally performed at our facility in Malaysia. Since most of our customers currently are located in Asia, Europe and the United States, our ability to assemble products in these markets and provide follow-on service from offices located in these regions is an important component of our global strategy. 

 

Our global manufacturing organization has expertise in optoelectronic, microelectronic, and integrated value-added assemblies for commercial, medical, aerospace, and defense industry applications. Our manufacturing includes silicon wafer processing and fabrication, optoelectronic device assembly and screening, thin and thick film microelectronic hybrid assemblies, and surface mounted and thru-hole PCB electronic assemblies, and value-added services including complete turn-key and box-build manufacturing. We outsource certain manufacturing operations including our sheet metal fabrication and certain plastic components. The manufacturing process for components and subsystems consists of manual tasks performed by skilled and semi-skilled workers as well as automated tasks. 

 

The principal raw materials and subcomponents used in producing our security inspection and detection systems consist of x-ray generators, detectors, data acquisition and computing devices, conveyor systems and video monitors. Substantially all of the optoelectronic devices, subsystems, circuit card assemblies and x-ray

generators used in our inspection and detection systems are manufactured in-house. We purchase the metal enclosures of the x-ray systems, x-ray tubes, computer hardware and certain standard mechanical parts from unaffiliated third party providers. 

 

The principal raw materials and subcomponents used in producing our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems consist of silicon wafers, ceramics, electronic subcomponents, light emitting diodes, phototransistors, printed circuit boards, headers and caps, housings, cables, filters and packaging materials. The silicon-based optoelectronic devices manufactured by us are critical components in most of our subsystems. Since 1987, we have purchased substantially all of the silicon wafers we use to manufacture our optoelectronic devices from Wacker Siltronic Corp. 

 

The principal raw materials and subcomponents used in producing our medical diagnostic and imaging systems consist of electronic subcomponents, printed circuit boards, housings, cables, filters and packaging materials. 

 

Although to date none of our groups has experienced any significant shortages or material delays in obtaining any of its raw materials or subcomponents, there can be no assurance that they will not face such shortages or delays in one or more materials in the future. For cost, quality control and efficiency reasons, we generally purchase raw materials and subcomponents only from single vendors with whom we have ongoing relationships. We do, however, qualify second sources for most of our raw materials and critical components, or have identified alternate sources of supply. We purchase the materials pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Although to date we have not experienced any significant shortages or material delays in obtaining any of our raw materials or subcomponents, there can be no assurance that we will not face such shortages or delays in one or more of these materials in the future.

Licenses. 

 

In June 1999, as part of an arbitration settlement, we entered into a fully paid-up, nonexclusive patent license agreement with PerkinElmer, Inc., formerly known as EG&G, Inc. (“EG&G”) for U.S. Patent No. 4,366,382. The patent expired in September 2000. Subsequent to the end of the patent term, we have been free to use the technology without patent or license restriction. Under the license, for which we paid $450,000, we were permitted to make, use and sell or otherwise dispose of security and inspection products that use an x-ray line scan system for baggage inspection purposes covered by EG&G’s patent. 

 

In December 1998, as part of the settlement of certain litigation, we and Lunar Corporation (“Lunar”) made payments to each other, which resulted in a net payment to us of $400,000. As part of the settlement, the parties entered into a license agreement pursuant to which we were granted a fully paid up worldwide, nonexclusive license under U.S. Patent Nos. 4,626,688 (the “688 patent”) and 5,138,167 (the “167 patent”) in the non-medical field. We paid Lunar $1.5 million for this fully paid up license. Prior to our acquisition of Osteometer in September 1998, Osteometer had also been involved in litigation with Lunar regarding the 688 and 167 patents. In December 1998, the parties to this litigation entered into a settlement agreement. As a part of the settlement, the parties entered into a license agreement pursuant to which Osteometer was granted a worldwide, nonexclusive license under the 688 and 167 patents for certain bone densitometers. Osteometer made an initial royalty payment of $250,000 with respect to products manufactured prior to entering into this license agreement and we will make royalty payments on future sales of the licensed products. The license expires in December 2003 or the last to expire of the licensed patents, whichever is later.

Environmental Regulations 

 

We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, and disposal of certain hazardous substances and wastes used or generated in the manufacturing and assembly of our products. Under such laws, we may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances that have been or are being released on or in our facilities or that have been or are being disposed of off site as waste. Such laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of such hazardous substances. In the past, we have conducted a Phase I environmental assessment report for each of the properties in the United States at which we manufacture products. The purpose of each such report was to identify, as of the date of that report, potential sources of contamination of the property. In certain cases, we have received a Phase II environmental assessment report consisting of further soil testing and other investigations deemed appropriate by an independent environmental consultant. We believe that we are currently in compliance with all material environmental regulations in connection with our manufacturing operations, and that we have obtained all material environmental permits necessary to conduct our business. The amount of hazardous substances and wastes produced and generated by us may increase in the future depending on changes in our operations. Any failure by us to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing process or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

 

We discovered soil and groundwater contamination at our Hawthorne, California facility. We have filed the requisite reports concerning this problem with the appropriate environmental authorities in fiscal 2001. We have not yet received any response to such reports, and no agency action or litigation is presently pending or threatened. We also have notified the prior owners of the facility and the present owners and tenants of adjacent properties concerning the problem and have requested from such parties agreements to toll of the statute of limitations with respect to actions against such parties with respect to the contamination in order that we may focus our attention on resolution of the contamination problem. Our site was previously used for semiconductor manufacturing similar to that presently conducted on the site by us, and it is not presently known who is responsible for the contamination and the remediation. The groundwater contamination is a known regional problem, not limited to our premises or our immediate surroundings. 

 

Competition 

 

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by evolving customer needs and rapid technological change. We compete with a number of other manufacturers, some of which have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. In addition, these competitors may have the ability to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements, have stronger customer relationships, have greater name recognition, and may devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against any current or future competitors in the security and inspection, optoelectronic devices and subsystems, and medical imaging and monitoring markets or that future competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. 

 

In the security and inspection market, competition is based primarily on such factors as product performance, functionality and quality, the overall cost effectiveness of the system, prior customer relationships, technological capabilities of the products, price, local market presence, and breadth of sales and service organization. We believe that our principal competitors in the market for security and inspection products are the Detection Systems division of L-3 Communications Corporation, Smiths Detection, American Science and Engineering, Inc., SAIC, Control Screening L.L.C., CEIA SpA, Garrett Electronics, Inc., and Nuctech Company Limited. Competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins, and loss of our market share. In the airline and airport security and inspection market, particularly in the upgrade and replacement market, we also compete for potential customers based on existing relationships between our competitors and the customers. Certain of our competitors have been manufacturing inspection systems since the 1980s and have established

Table of Contents
strong relationships with airlines and airport authorities. We believe that the image quality and resolution of certain of our security and inspection products is superior to the image quality offered by most of our competitors’ x-ray based inspection products. Additionally, our true multi-zone metal detection technology provides the ability to detect small metallic objects and offer higher levels of discrimination in weapons-screening applications. Although we also have established relationships with a number of airport and airline customers, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully compete in the future with existing competitors or with new entrants. In the large cargo inspection systems market, we compete for potential customers based on price, performance and the ability to design both standard and customized products. Several of our competitors have operated in this area for longer than we have. However, due to our recent successes in designing and delivering high-energy x-ray systems, we believe we have demonstrated our ability to compete effectively. Additionally, although our competitors in the large cargo inspection market each offer products in competition with one or more of our products, our ability to supply high-energy x-ray, gamma-ray, pulsed fast neutron analysis, and thermal neutron analysis systems means that we offer among the widest array of solutions available from a single supplier. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that our competitors in this area will not expand their product lines. 

 

In the optoelectronic devices and subsystems market, competition for optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems is based primarily on such factors as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices, product quality, timeliness of delivery, price, customer technical support, and on the ability to provide fully integrated services from application development and design through production. We believe that our major competitors in the optoelectronic device and subsystem market are PerkinElmer, Hamamatsu Corporation, and Honeywell Optoelectronics. Because we specialize in custom subsystems requiring a high degree of engineering expertise, we believe that we generally do not compete to any significant degree with any other large United States, European or Asian manufacturers of standard optoelectronic components. 

 

In the medical imaging and monitoring systems market, competition in the U.S. stems primarily from GE Lunar Corporation, Hologic, Masimo Corporation, Nellcor, and Norland Medical Systems. Internationally, we face competition from Aloka, Envitec, Elekon Industries, and Medison. 

 

Backlog 

 

We measure our backlog as orders for which purchase orders or contracts have been signed, but which have not yet been shipped and for which revenues have not yet been recognized. We typically ship our security and inspection products, optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems, and medical imaging and monitoring systems within one to several months after receiving an order. However, such shipments may be delayed for a variety of reasons including any special design or engineering requirements of the customer. In addition, large orders (more than ten machines) of security and inspection products typically require more lead-time. 

 

Large cargo scanning machines may require several months to several years lead-time. The only significant shipping delays we have experienced are with large cargo scanners. Such delays for many reasons, including: (i) additional time necessary to conduct large cargo system inspections at the factory before shipment; (ii) the customer’s need to engage in timely special site preparation to accommodate such a scanner, over which we have no control or responsibility; (iii) additional fine tuning of such scanners once they are installed; (iv) design or specification changes by the customer; and (v) delays originating from other contractors on the project. 

 

At June 30, 2003, our backlog totaled approximately $53.0 million, compared to approximately $89.6 million at June 30, 2002 and approximately $53.2 million at June 30, 2001. The decline in the backlog from June 30, 2002 to June 30, 2003 resulted primarily from the completion of several long term cargo projects during fiscal year 2003. Orders for these projects were received prior to June 30, 2002 and were included in the backlog on that date. We expect to ship most of our backlog as of June 30, 2003, during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004. Sales orders underlying our backlog are firm orders. Any failure by us to meet an agreed upon schedule

could lead to the cancellation of the related order. Moreover from time to time we may agree to permit the cancellation of an order on a negotiated basis. Variations in the size of the order, the product mix, and delivery requirements of the customer order may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period. Backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenues for any future period and cannot be considered a meaningful indicator of our performance on an annual or quarterly basis. 

 

Employees 

 

As of June 30, 2003, we employed approximately 1,165 people, of whom 790 were employed in manufacturing, 105 were employed in research and development, 115 were employed in finance and administration, 85 were employed in sales and marketing, and 70 were employed in our service organization. Of the total employees, approximately 580 were employed in the United States and Canada, 160 were employed in Europe, and 425 were employed in Asia. 12 employees of AME and 11 Metorex Security employees in Finland are union members and have collective bargaining rights; none of our other employees are unionized. We have never experienced a work stoppage or strike, and management believes that its relations with employees are good.
