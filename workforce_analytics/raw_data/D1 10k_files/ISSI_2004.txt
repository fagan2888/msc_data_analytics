Item 1. Business 

 

Overview 

 

We are a fabless semiconductor company that designs and markets high performance integrated circuits for the following key markets: (i) digital consumer electronics, (ii) networking, (iii) mobile communications and (iv) automotive electronics. Our primary products are high speed and low power SRAM and low and medium density DRAM. We also design and market EEPROMs and SmartCards, and we are developing selected non-memory products focusing on wireless chipsets using short range BlueTooth™ technology. We target high growth markets with our low cost, high quality semiconductor products and seek to build long-term relationships with our customers. We remain committed to produce many of the lower density and older memories that are of less interest to many larger manufacturers. 

 

Our outsourced manufacturing model is based upon a history of joint technology development relationships with key Asian foundries. For example, we had a technology development program for a 0.13 micron process with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC). We will also agree with a foundry to design a specific device to be manufactured in their wafer fabrication facility. We also make strategic equity purchases in selected foundries. For example, we invested a total of $42.0 million in Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). We have an established presence in the important Asian market that includes design groups in Shanghai, China and Hsinchu, Taiwan. These wholly-owned subsidiaries also have product engineering, sales and marketing, quality assurance, production control, and other operating functions. Our world headquarters are based in Santa Clara, California. 

 

Our customers include leaders in each of our four target markets including Apex, ChangHong, D-Link, Samsung and Sony in consumer electronics; 3Com, Ambit, Askey, Cisco and Yahoo! Japan in networking; Ericsson, LG Electronics, Motorola and Nokia in mobile communications; and Bose, Delphi, Philips and

Market Background 

 

In recent years, the need for sophisticated semiconductor memory architecture has expanded beyond the PC market and into electronic systems in a wide variety of markets including digital consumer electronics, networking, mobile communications and automotive electronics. Advances in technology have allowed for increasingly complex digital consumer systems such as DVD players, set-top boxes, digital cameras and HDTVs. Memory content is often required in these products to manage large amounts of data that create images and sounds in a digital format. As a result, virtually all digital consumer electronic systems incorporate semiconductor memory devices to enable and enhance system performance. 

 

As more consumers and businesses utilize the internet and broadband communications networks, the demand for products that connect to these networks has accelerated. Consumers and businesses require high speed access to internet content and other services to transmit and receive large amounts of data, such as highly graphical web sites, mp3 audio files and streaming multimedia applications. The numerous and complex applications that facilitate connections within networking and broadband products such as modems, switches and routers require optimized high speed memory architectures to maximize bus bandwidth and speed data transfer. 

 

Mobile communications products have gained broad acceptance among consumers. Applications for cellular communications, wide local area networks (WLAN) and global positioning systems (GPS) are increasingly able to access a range of data services, from internet connectivity to location detection, and are delivering information to consumers through mobile products. As the complexity and functionality of mobile communications products increases, so does the need for increased memory. These applications require the same memory performance as a non-mobile device, but the memory device must also conform to the mobile needs of low power and small footprint. The base stations interacting with mobile devices also have memory content that can be supplied by ISSI. 

 

The complexity of automobile electronics is also increasing rapidly. The significant increase in automotive electronics systems has resulted in an increase in microcontrollers and memory responsible for delivering control and command functionality. Automobile designers are increasing semiconductor content in automobiles to allow for improved telematics, digital audio and video entertainment systems, and powertrain functions such as engine control and fuel efficiency management systems. These systems require memory devices that must meet the automotive industry’s high quality and reliability standards. 

 

Integrated circuits that address the semiconductor memory market can be segmented into volatile memory, such as DRAM and SRAM, and non-volatile memory, such as Flash and EEPROM. Volatile memory loses the data if the electricity is turned off while non-volatile memory retains the data when the electricity is turned off. SRAM is used for applications that require very high speed access to stored data, and typically requires four to six transistors to store each bit of data. DRAM uses only a single transistor to store each bit of data. This is why

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table of Contents
the storage capacity of DRAM tends to be much greater than that of SRAM. Because of these factors, SRAM is faster than DRAM, but more expensive on a cost per bit basis. The same equipment manufacturers that use high performance SRAM may also use low and medium density DRAM, and such products can be sold through the same channels. 

 

System designers use SRAM in the most performance sensitive portions of their memory architecture. High performance SRAM operates at either very high speed or very low power. High speed SRAM is used in applications such as base stations, bridges, routers, modems and peripherals. Low power SRAM is used in applications such as the wireless handheld and mobile phone markets. 

 

The DRAM market can be segmented into high density devices (currently 512 Mb and above) and low and medium density devices (currently 256 Mb and below). High density DRAM is used in applications that require high capacity storage such as PCs and other high-end computing devices. Currently, DRAM in PCs is migrating from 256 Mb to 512 Mb and above. Low and medium density DRAM is used in applications such as digital consumer electronics, networking, mobile communications and automotive electronics which require less memory capacity than PCs and high end computing applications. Large captive memory manufacturers tend to focus production on higher density DRAM devices, where the volumes are greater and manufacturing economies of scale can be optimized. As a result, to the extent the large, captive memory manufacturers limit or cease production of low and medium density DRAM, customers may seek a new long-term, steady supply of these products. 

 

Memory suppliers compete on the basis of speed, power consumption, density, reliability and cost, all of which are a function of process technology and design expertise. Success in the memory market is determined not only by the quality of the device design but also by the process through which the device can be fabricated. Process technology improvements allow design line widths to be reduced, which in turn allow the integrated circuit design to operate at faster speeds and increased memory density. To meet the demands for high performance memories, a memory supplier must also have a wafer fabrication strategy allowing it to migrate to the newest generations of process technology on a timely basis. Process technology shifts occur frequently and are developed in high end wafer fabrication facilities that typically cost over $1.0 billion. Although most of the large multinational memory companies fabricate their own semiconductor wafers, fabless suppliers rely on third-party wafer foundries. The fabless model is much less capital intensive, but requires strong relationships with foundries to secure wafer supply and access to advanced process technology. 

 

The manufacturing of many products in the digital consumer electronics, networking and mobile communication markets is largely based in Asia. As a result, many semiconductor companies have increased their sales and design presence in Asia to be closer to key customers, and to obtain access to lower cost engineering and manufacturing resources. Semiconductor companies that have a strong Asian presence may have a competitive advantage in securing business from manufacturers located in this region. 

 

The demand for high performance memory products across a variety of end markets provides a substantial opportunity for a focused supplier of high performance memory integrated circuits. 

 

Strategy 

 

Since our inception in 1988, we have developed a broad range of SRAM products that enable designers to meet the demanding density, speed, cost, reliability and power consumption requirements of semiconductors used in high technology products. We have also established ourselves as a supplier of low and medium density DRAM products, which are complementary to our SRAM products. For both product lines, we emphasize our commitment to be a long-term provider of the older, smaller density products that are of less interest to some of our larger competitors. Our customers are among the largest manufacturers in the digital consumer electronics, networking, mobile communications and automotive electronic markets. Unlike many other fabless semiconductor companies, we employ our own process development team to work collaboratively with our key

foundry suppliers. From time to time we have also made equity purchases in selected wafer foundries. Our management has extensive experience working with Asian foundries. These factors allow us to build strong relationships with our foundry suppliers and facilitate access to leading edge process technology and wafer capacity. The key elements of our strategy are: 

 

Build Collaborative Relationships with Leading Edge Foundries.    We work in a highly collaborative mode with our principal wafer foundries in developing leading edge process technology that is critical in advanced memories. We entered our first development program with TSMC in 1990 and with Chartered Semiconductor in 1994. Through this collaborative model, we have been able to repeatedly be in the forefront as process technology moves to smaller geometries. In addition, from time to time we will agree to design a specific memory device requested by a foundry. As part of our manufacturing strategy, we have also made strategic equity purchases in key foundries such as SMIC, and in the past, TSMC. We believe our collaborative development efforts and equity purchases have enabled us to have more secure access to wafer capacity even during industry up cycles. For example, in late 2003 and early 2004, foundry wafers were generally on allocation but we were able to increase our wafer starts and grow our revenue on a quarterly basis. 

 

Commit to Being a Long-Term Supplier of our Products.    We are a long-term supplier of products to many of our customers. Our fabless model provides us the flexibility to accommodate small volume production runs for products such as low and medium density memories. In contrast, many large captive suppliers will reduce or cease production of lower density products in periods of tight capacity as manufacturing such products is less attractive to them than making higher density memories which typically have higher volumes and greater economies of scale. As an example, we still supply low density 4 Mb DRAM and 64K SRAM, while most large captive memory companies ceased production of such devices several years ago. 

 

Continue to Develop and Offer High Performance Products.    We provide cost effective, high performance products including a complete family of SRAM products and a range of low and medium density DRAM products. We work with our customers to identify the memory requirements of their next generation products and then focus our development efforts on achieving high performance standards through advanced process technology, circuit density, high speed, reliability and optimized power consumption. Examples of our high performance product offerings include a 36 Mb synchronous SRAM product targeting high-end networking applications and a 256 Mb Synchronous DRAM product targeting the digital consumer electronics and networking markets. 

 

Expand our Low Cost Asian-Based Development Teams Close to our Customers.    We intend to continue to capitalize on our extensive experience in Asia. We have established low cost engineering development teams close to our customers through our subsidiaries in Taiwan and China. As evidence of this strategy, in the last year we have grown our design and engineering groups in Shanghai, China and Hsinchu, Taiwan, and we now employ over 90 design and engineering professionals in these locations. In fact, we now employ more individuals in Asia than in North America. 

 

Further Penetrate Industry Leading Customers.    We leverage our expertise in producing high quality memory products to penetrate our target markets through industry leading accounts, such as Apex, ChangHong, D-Link, Samsung and Sony in digital consumer electronics; 3Com, Ambit, Askey, Cisco and Yahoo! Japan in networking; Ericsson, LG Electronics, Motorola and Nokia in mobile communications; and Bose, Delphi, Philips and Siemens in automotive electronics. We target these customers because we believe they drive high volumes in their markets and define the direction of future memory requirements. Our success with these market leaders enables us to attract other customers and diversify our customer base. 

 

Develop Selected Non-Memory Products for Key Markets.    We are developing selected non-memory products for use in our key markets. Our goal is to increase product diversification and to offer products that are synergistic with our SRAM and DRAM expertise. Our initial non-memory products are expected to be Bluetooth and other wireless chipsets. Most of the development work for our non-memory products is performed by our Taiwan and China design groups. We believe we can succeed in these markets by capitalizing on our experience in small die size design and low cost manufacturing.

Our sales and marketing efforts are directed from our Santa Clara headquarters, but we also have sales and marketing teams in Asia and a sales team in Europe. We market and sell our products in Asia, the U.S. and Europe through our direct sales force, independent sales representatives and distributors. We have distributors in North America and in many countries in Europe, including a Pan-European distributor. In Asia, we sell primarily through distributors who work closely with our Asian resident direct sales force. We have sales offices in the U.S., Europe, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Korea and India. Our marketing group focuses on product strategy, product development road maps, new product introduction, demand assessment and competitive analysis. The group also ensures that product launches, channel marketing programs, and ongoing demand and supply planning occur on a well-managed, timely basis. 

 

In fiscal 2004, no single customer accounted for over 10% of our total net sales. In fiscal 2003, sales to ATM Electronic Corporation, a distributor in Taiwan, accounted for approximately 10% of our total net sales. A substantial portion of our sales to ATM were for delivery to Ambit. In fiscal 2002 no single customer accounted for over 10% of our total net sales. The percentage of our revenues from customers located outside the U.S. was approximately 70%, 87%, and 87% in fiscal 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. We anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales. The percentages of our revenues by region are set forth in the following table:

Our sales are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders, which can be revised to reflect changes in the customer’s requirements. Generally, our purchase orders and OEM agreements allow customers to reschedule delivery dates and cancel purchase orders without significant penalties. For these reasons, we believe that our backlog, while useful for scheduling production, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues.

Markets and Products 

 

Our memory products are used in a variety of specific applications within the digital consumer electronics, networking, mobile communications and automotive electronics markets. In particular, our SRAM products are used in WLANs, base stations, networking switches and routers, DSL modems, LCD TVs, set-top boxes, GPS systems, instrumentation, engine control systems, telematics, audio and video equipment, satellite radio, POS terminals, fax machines, copiers, tape drives, and other applications. Our low and medium density DRAM products are used in base stations, DVD players, DSL modems, set-top boxes, digital cameras, flat panel TVs, LCD TVs, HDTVs, printers, audio equipment and other applications. Many of the same customers that purchase our SRAM products also purchase our DRAM products. 

 

Historically, SRAM products generated a majority of our revenue, largely for networking and telecommunications applications. However, in the last several years, these markets remained relatively flat and, in the same period, we experienced rapid growth in the consumer electronics market for our low and medium density DRAM products. As a result, we now derive a majority of our revenue from DRAM products. 

 

SRAM.    Our SRAM strategy is to offer a broad range of devices and be a complete supplier of a customer’s SRAM requirements. We offer advanced, leading-edge products, such as our new 36 Mb synchronous SRAM, and we also make long-term supply commitments on established SRAM products, such as a 32K x 8, 5 volt asynchronous SRAM. Our high performance SRAM products generally focus on either high speed or low power applications. 

 

We offer both asynchronous and synchronous high speed SRAM products. Our high speed asynchronous SRAM products are used in applications such as LANs, telecommunication equipment and base stations, bridges, routers, modems, automotive electronics, multimedia products, peripherals, and industrial instrumentation. Driven by demand in the wireless handheld and mobile phone markets, we have developed a low power family of SRAM products for wireless applications. Our high speed synchronous SRAM products are used in a variety of networking and telecommunications, such as high performance bridges and routers, as well as in automotive applications. Additional SRAM products under development are expected to include performance-leading features in speed, configuration, power levels, density and packaging.

DRAM.    Our DRAM strategy is to be a long-term supplier of low and medium density DRAM products. Our DRAM is not targeted at the main memory DRAM market and we do not compete in markets requiring the highest density DRAM products used in PCs and workstations. Instead, we provide 4, 16, 64 and 128 Mb DRAM and, in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we will begin selling a 256 Mb DRAM. Applications for our low and medium density DRAM include products such as DVD players, set-top boxes, DSL modems, digital still cameras, printers, automotive electronics, base stations, networking equipment, disk drives, tape drives and PDAs. Most of these applications do not require high density products, and our customers’ memory component strategy typically follows behind one or more generations the high density DRAM market. Additional DRAM products, including low power synchronous DRAM products, are under development.

EEPROM and Other Memory Products.    Our other memory products include high performance serial EEPROM, embedded EEPROM products targeted at SmartCard applications, and voice recording chips. Applications for these products include pagers, networking systems, modems, telephone sets, security systems, video games, automobiles and other consumer products. Annual revenue from these products did not exceed 5% of our total annual revenue for fiscal 2002, 2003 or 2004. 

 

Product Warranty.    Consistent with semiconductor memory industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our semiconductor memory devices are in compliance with specifications existing at the time of delivery. Liability for a stated warranty period is usually limited to replacement of defective items or return of amounts paid. 

 

Manufacturing 

 

We outsource our manufacturing operations including wafer fabrication, assembly and testing. Our wafer fabrication strategy is to build collaborative relationships with leading foundries and we sometimes purchase strategic equity interests in selected foundries. Because memory products are particularly well suited for the development of advanced process technology, we seek to participate in developing and refining the process technology used to manufacture many of our products. We believe that this strategy gives us a competitive advantage and enables us to achieve the early introduction of smaller geometries for our memory products, which results in increased performance and lower manufacturing costs, as well as facilitates access to needed capacity. Historically, our principal manufacturing relationships have been with TSMC in Taiwan and with Chartered Semiconductor in Singapore. In fiscal 2002, we began production at SMIC in China and, in fiscal 2003, we began production at ProMOS and Powerchip in Taiwan. 

 

In addition to building process technology development relationships, we are differentiated from many other fabless semiconductor companies because we have purchased strategic equity interests in selected foundries. For example, in fiscal 2000, we committed to purchase $40.0 million in equity in SMIC, the first 8-inch wafer foundry in China, located in the Shanghai/Pudong area near our China subsidiary. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer served on SMIC’s board of directors until SMIC’s initial public offering in March 2004. Previously, we held equity interests in TSMC and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC). 

 

The manufacturing of our products begins at independent wafer foundries. Once the foundry has completed wafer processing, the wafers are shipped to subcontractors for wafer testing. They are then cut into individual memory chips, assembled into final packages and tested at our third-party subcontractors in Taiwan, Singapore and China. Our operations groups in the U.S., China and Taiwan perform subcontractor management. We are certified under ISO 9001/2000 standards and our quality system is periodically reviewed and approved by both ISO certifiers and our customers. We plan to achieve compliance with ISO/TS 16949:2002, the new automotive standard, and ISO 14001, the environmental standard, in the future.

Each of our wafer suppliers also fabricates for other integrated circuit companies, including certain of our competitors. In addition, some of our wafer suppliers manufacture memories for their own account. Although we are allocated specific wafer capacity from our suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such capacity in periods of tight supply. There can be no assurance that the foundries we use will not encounter construction or production difficulties or that they will allocate sufficient wafer capacity to satisfy our wafer requirements, especially in times of wafer capacity shortages. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we would be able to qualify additional manufacturing sources for existing or new products in a timely manner or that such additional manufacturing sources would be able to produce an adequate supply of wafers. If we were unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers from our current or any alternative sources in a timely manner, our business and operating results would be harmed. 

 

Our suppliers for wafer testing, assembly, and final test also provide services to other companies. There can be no assurance that these suppliers will not encounter production difficulties or that they will allocate sufficient capacity to satisfy our requirements. If we were unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafer testing, assembly, or final test services, our business and operating results would be harmed. 

 

Competition 

 

The semiconductor market is intensely competitive and has been characterized by cyclical market conditions, an oversupply of product, price erosion, rapid technological change and short product life cycles. We compete primarily on the basis of the following factors: 

 

  • the pricing of our products;  

 

  • the supply and cost of wafers;  

 

  • product design, functionality, performance and reliability;  

 

  • successful and timely product development;  

 

  • wafer manufacturing over or under capacity;  

 

  • access to advanced process technologies at competitive prices; and  

 

  • access to assembly and test capacity.  

 

We may not be able to compete successfully in the future as to any of these factors and our failure to do so could harm our business. 

 

In the market for SRAM products we compete with several domestic and international semiconductor companies including Alliance Semiconductor, Cypress, Etron, Giga Semiconductor, ICSI, Integrated Device Technology, NEC, Renesas Technology, Samsung, Sony and ST Microelectronics. We also may face significant competition from other domestic and foreign integrated circuit manufacturers which have advanced technological capabilities but are not currently participating in the SRAM market sector. 

 

In the low to medium density DRAM area we generally compete with Hynix, ICSI, Micron, Nanya, Samsung, Oki and Winbond. In addition, there are several fabless Taiwanese companies that are competitors, including ESMT, and Etron. Other large DRAM manufacturers could address the low and medium density DRAM market in the future. 

 

In the EEPROM market, our primary competitors include Atmel, Catalyst and STMicroelectronics. We also compete with many small to medium-sized companies in one or more segments of the market. 

 

Certain of our competitors offer broader product lines and have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than us. In industry down cycles, they may be willing to sell below fully absorbed costs at prices we cannot match. We may not be able to compete successfully against any of these competitors.

The process technology used by our manufacturing sources, including process technology that we have developed jointly with our foundries, can be used by such foundries to produce products for other companies, including our competitors. Although we believe that our participation in the development of the processes provides us the advantage of early access to such processes, the knowledge of the wafer manufacturer may be used to benefit our competitors. 

 

Research and Development 

 

Rapid technological change and continuing price competition require research and development efforts on both new products and advanced processes employing smaller geometries. Our research and development activities are focused primarily on the development of new memory circuit designs at the smallest die size and utilization of advanced process technology with the smallest geometries. We currently have design teams in Santa Clara, California, Taiwan, and China. Our research and development expenditures in fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, were $20.8 million, $23.4 million, and $29.8 million, respectively. 

 

New SRAM products in design include high speed synchronous devices and several asynchronous SRAMs we re-designed for more advanced process technology. We have new 64 Mb and 128 Mb DRAM devices under design. We are developing new products on advanced 0.13, 0.14 and 0.15 micron process technologies. We are presently evaluating 90-nanometer process technology for our next generation products. In nonvolatile memory, our future products are expected to include 256K and 512K density serial EEPROM devices. 

 

We plan to add selected non-memory products to diversify our product portfolio. Our non-memory products will be targeted at our key markets. Our wireless chipset product line is a non-memory product line. In fiscal 2002, we acquired certain Bluetooth and wireless chipset rights and technology in connection with an equity investment in a development-stage company, Signia Technologies, and have formed a joint development program with them. Our Bluetooth and other wireless chipsets can be used for short distance wireless communication for applications such as cell phones, PDAs, PC peripherals, headsets and other consumer products. Most of the development work for our non-memory products is performed by our Taiwan and China design groups. Through fiscal 2004, there has been no revenue from our non-memory products, and we do not predict material revenue being generated from such products in fiscal 2005. 

 

Patents and Intellectual Property 

 

As of September 30, 2004, we held 73 U.S. patents. These patents expire between 2010 and 2020. We have 10 additional patent applications pending and expect to continue to file patent applications where appropriate to protect our proprietary technologies. We do not currently hold any non-U.S. patents. Although patents are an important element of our intellectual property, we believe that our continued success depends primarily on factors such as the technological skills and innovation of our personnel rather than on our patents. The process of seeking patent protection can be expensive and time consuming. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending or future applications or that, if patents are issued, they will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that any rights granted thereunder will provide meaningful protection or other commercial advantage to us. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any patent rights will be upheld in the future or that we will be able to preserve any of our other intellectual property rights. 

 

In the semiconductor industry, it is not unusual for companies to receive notices alleging infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others. We have been, and from time-to-time expect to be, notified of claims that we may be infringing patents, maskwork rights or copyrights owned by third parties. If it appears necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses under patents that we are alleged to be infringing. Although patent holders commonly offer such licenses, licenses may not be offered and the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us. The failure to obtain a license under a key patent or intellectual property right from a third party for technology used by us could harm our business.

Part of our outsourcing strategy includes licensing product designs. To control our R&D expenses, we regularly license some of our SRAM and DRAM designs from ICSI, other companies or our foundries. We also license our own designs to ICSI or other companies. 

 

Employees 

 

As of September 30, 2004, we had 310 employees worldwide, including 108 employees in the U.S., 89 in China, 98 in Taiwan, 8 in Hong Kong, 2 in India, 2 in Europe and 3 in Korea. Our future success will largely be dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel. The employment market for such personnel is competitive and there can be no assurance that we will successfully staff all necessary positions. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, we have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe our employee relations are good.
