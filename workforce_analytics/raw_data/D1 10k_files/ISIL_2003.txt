Item 1.    Business 

 

General 

 

We are a global designer and manufacturer of high performance analog, integrated circuits and wireless networking solutions. Our portfolio addresses four growing markets in the industry – power management, optical storage (CD and DVD recordable), flat panel displays and wireless networking. We bring added customer value in wireless networking by providing complete silicon, software and reference design solutions to new products that enhance the computing experience. 

 

Our Business Strategy 

 

Our business strategy emphasizes the following key elements: 

 

  —   Focus on High Growth Markets.    We focus our investments on markets with the potential for high growth. We believe that demand for optical storage, flat panel displays, power management and wireless networking will be higher than the overall semiconductor industry.  

 

  —   Maintain Technology Leadership.    We have over 650 employees working on innovative solutions for analog and wireless architectures. In conjunction with these efforts, we continue to expand our strong intellectual property position by seeking to increase our existing portfolio of over 1,300 patents.  

 

  —   Provide Systems Level Solutions to Our Customers.    We design and develop our semiconductors with a systems level approach that we believe enhances the value of our products as they are designed into and incorporated in our customers’ electronic systems. This approach yields early integration of our products into our customers’ products, provides opportunities for current design wins, and ultimately increases revenue as our solutions are incorporated within a targeted end application.  

 

  —   Partner with Industry Leaders.    We partner with industry leaders in each of our target end-user markets to take our strong engineering and design capabilities to commercial levels. Our customer base of industry leaders illustrates the acceptance of our products to date, and we continue to partner with these customers and others to develop and market our next generation products.

  —   Maintain High Quality Customer Service.    Quality customer service is critical to our customer retention and sales growth. Through our customer relations initiatives, we believe we distinguish ourselves from our competitors. Additionally, our sales force and authorized representatives and distributors provide customer information programs and support for our global comprehensive customer service efforts.  

 

History 

 

We were formed on August 13, 1999 through a series of transactions, in which we and our wholly owned subsidiary, Intersil Communications, Inc., or Intersil Communications, acquired the semiconductor business of Harris Corporation, or Harris. On March 16, 2001, we sold the assets of our Discrete Power products group to Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, or Fairchild, for $338.0 million in cash and the assumption by Fairchild of certain liabilities of the product group. On May 14, 2002, we consummated the merger with Elantec Semiconductor, Inc. or Elantec. 

 

Products and Technology 

 

Our products are organized into five principal product groups: Power Management, Elantec, Standard Analog, Wireless Networking and Automotive. We discontinued our Automotive product group during 2002 and therefore we do not expect to recognize significant revenue from this product group in the future.

To improve the comparability of the product group results above, the Elantec Non-GAAP revenue amounts above include 19 weeks of revenue totaling $41.6 million, which was earned in fiscal year 2002 prior to our merger. Additionally, the affect of our change in revenue recognition policy ($14.9 million) for sales to North American distributors is not reflected in the amounts above. 

 

Power Management 

 

Our Power Management product group represented 26.4% of our fiscal year 2002 Non-GAAP revenue. We have a portfolio of analog, mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs) optimized for power management applications in computing, datacom or networking, wireless data and voice communications infrastructure applications. 

 

Our power management solutions for computing applications are designed into desktop computers, notebook computers, file servers, workstations and a variety of handheld computing devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs). We have also developed new power management ICs for cable and DSL modems, set-top boxes, 48 volt telecom servers and 24x7 server networks supporting e-commerce on the Internet. Our highly successful Endura™ family of power management ICs is used in about half of all personal computers that utilize Pentium™ 4 and Athlon™ microprocessors. To date we have shipped over 500 million Endura ICs into computing applications. 

 

We also offer a family of ICs used to power graphics processors and double data rate (DDR) memory as well as advanced configuration power interface (ACPI) solutions for “instant on” and “sleep mode” capability used to save energy in personal computers. In addition, we have invested in Primarion, Inc., a privately-held IC design company, to develop next-generation, digitally-controlled multiphase power management solutions for high-end computing applications such as blade servers. These high-current applications with thermal limitations require a new power management approach. 

 

Elantec 

 

Our Elantec product group comprised 14.9% of our fiscal year 2002 Non-GAAP revenue, which for presentation purposes includes four months of revenue earned prior to the merger. We design and manufacture our Elantec products for three high growth commercial markets that we believe are increasingly demanding high performance and low power consumption analog solutions: video displays, optical storage, and communications. In each of our target markets, we offer a suite of standard products and application specific standard products (“ASSPs”) that are designed to provide effective solutions for electronic systems designers by addressing a number of common component requirements. Our standard products are used in more than one of these markets, while each ASSP is used in only one specific market. 

 

Video displays are being incorporated into an increasing number of electronic devices. This trend has increased demand for high-speed amplifiers and specialty analog circuits for the processing and display of video signals. In addition, the use of TFT-LCD flat panel display technology in desktop monitors, notebooks and other consumer applications continues to grow. Optical storage, in the form of CD-ROM, has become the medium of

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table of Contents
choice for software and music. More recently, optical recordable devices, such as, CD read/write, and DVD read/write, are being adopted in the marketplace. The use of writeable optical drives in personal computers and consumer equipment is driving growth in the demand for laser diode drivers. In the communications market, we supply transceivers, line drivers, and high-speed amplifiers for ADSL, HDSL, and VDSL for increasing the data transmission rate over conventional telephone lines. 

 

Standard Analog 

 

Intersil is a leader in standard building block ICs for the communications signal chain and the industrial, instrumentation and handheld equipment markets. This group of products represented 18.1% of our total 2002 Non-GAAP revenue. Our broad families of interface protocol, switches and multiplexers offer our customers a wide array of options in terms of temperature ranges, package styles, and voltage inputs. All of the interface products that we released in 2002 were targeted at handheld applications, where we have a competitive advantage in offering the world’s smallest RS-232 devices. Overall, our Standard Analog products typically have long life cycles once designed into our customers’ products. 

 

Wireless Networking 

 

Our Wireless Networking product group represented 33.8% of our fiscal year 2002 Non-GAAP revenue. We are the leading developer of semiconductor solutions for the growing wireless LAN market, focusing our product development around the widely adopted IEEE 802.11 global standards. Since the great majority of wireless networking and equipment manufacturers have or are deploying systems compliant to the 802.11 standards, we support both the standard and the Wi-Fi™ Alliance seal of approval. 

 

Our PRISM® family of chip sets addresses the growing demand for wireless networking systems for use in both the home and business place . Such systems provide cost effective, wireless access to high data rate broadband communications networks. We have the most complete set of products in the market that span a wide range of technologies and platforms including reference designs, software and all ICs necessary for wireless data communications at data rates from 1 to 54 Mbps across the 2.4 and 5 Ghz bands. We support the main IEEE 802.11 b, a, and g standards with full system solutions as well as multiband and multimode solutions culminating in a full a/b/g worldband radio solution thus covering every major standard in one compact design. All PRISM® ICs represent design and manufacturing competence in RF, mixed-signal and digital technologies. The power amplifiers, radio frequency/intermediate frequency (RF/IF), up and down converters, and quadrature modulator/demodulators are designed and manufactured using various combinations of high-performance SiGe process technology, and Intersil’s own proprietary BiCMOS process. Baseband processors (BBPs), medium access controllers (MACs), and integrated BBPs/MACs are designed and manufactured using sub-micron CMOS process technologies. 

 

Because we design all of the ICs in our wireless chip set and offer design aids such as reference designs and software, we believe this complete solution provides our customers with optimized and matched performance, value and fast time-to-market. We believe the PRISM® “turnkey” solution is a critical competitive advantage for us and translates into a competitive advantage for our customers, especially in emerging markets. 

 

We have now shipped over 20 million 802.11b chipsets through three full generations of product—PRISM 2, PRISM 2.5, and now PRISM 3. PRISM 2 was the world’s first 11 Mbps radio and set new range and throughput standards, PRISM 2.5 led the way into embedded solutions with PCI and mini-PCI interfaces and combo modem/WLAN boards, and PRISM 3 is still leading in cost, power, and size in the .11b marketplace. This latest PRISM 3 generation of product has resulted in the lowest power solution on the market to service handheld and portable applications, the smallest form factors including the incredibly small SDIO and embeddable BGA module, all while leading the charge toward lowest total cost. A competitive total bill of materials coupled with the most reliable and highest performing 802.11b radio on the market have led to a product with the lowest total

cost of ownership that continues to compete in all high volume applications. PRISM 3 consists of only three chips and has led the way using new zero IF technology to reduce total cost. This has made wireless LAN technology available to more cost sensitive applications like handheld computers, tablets, and other consumer electronics devices. 

 

We plan to leverage our leading market position and proven high volume production experience to support new and emerging wireless LAN markets. Our Indigo™ 5 GHz wireless platform, supporting the IEEE 802.11a standard, became available in the third quarter of 2002 and is now in full production. We also launched PRISM GT, the world’s first 802.11g solution in the fourth quarter of 2002. PRISM Duette, the world’s highest performing full a/b/g solution, was launched in the fourth quarter of 2002. PRISM GT and PRISM Duette are both setting new performance levels in the industry and all at competitive pricing and with the same proven software and support found in previous PRISM products. 

 

Automotive 

 

In March 2001, we announced the closure of our Findlay, Ohio fabrication facility and the exit of our Automotive product line. In September 2002, the Findlay plant, which was the primary production location for our Automotive products line, was sold and all production related to operations ceased. Our Automotive product line contributed $47.6 million in Non-GAAP revenue during fiscal year 2002, however due to our exit of this business, we do not expect the product line to contribute material revenue in future periods. 

 

Geographic Financial Summary 

 

We operate exclusively in the semiconductor industry. Substantially all revenues result from the sale of semiconductor products. A summary of the operations by geographic area is summarized below (in thousands):

The 46 weeks in the year ended June 30, 2000 is a result of the sale of the semiconductor business from Harris. The 26 weeks in the stub year ended December 29, 2000 is the result of the change in our year end. 

 

Export sales included in U.S. operations were $227.5 million for the 46 weeks ended June 30, 2000, $163.9 million for the 26 weeks ended December 29, 2000, and $3.7 million for the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2001. There were no export sales included in US operations in the 53 weeks ended January 3, 2003. 

 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

 

In fiscal year 2002, we derived about 62% of our sales from original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers and contract manufacturers. We derived 38% of our sales through distributors and value added resellers. Our sales organizations are supported by logistics organizations. Product orders flow to our fabrication facilities or to one of our foundries where the semiconductor die is made. Most of our semiconductors are

Table of Contents
assembled and tested through independent subcontractors. Products are then shipped to the customer either directly or indirectly via third party or internally-owned warehouses in the United States, Asia/Pacific and Europe. 

 

To serve our customer base, we maintain a highly focused, direct sales force selling products for each of our targeted product areas, combined with a network of distributors and manufacturers’ representatives. We have dedicated direct sales organizations operating in the Asia/Pacific, Americas and Europe regions that serve our major OEM customers and distributors. We have strategically located our sales offices near these major OEM customers. Our technical sales force is aligned by product group, assuring an application and product focus. We also maintain a dedicated marketing organization, which supports each product area. 

 

Manufacturers’ representatives generally do not offer products that compete directly with our products, but may offer complementary items manufactured by others. Manufacturers’ representatives do not maintain a product inventory; instead, their customers place large quantity orders directly with us and are referred to distributors for smaller orders. 

 

Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products, including products that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Some of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for market price fluctuations and/or the right of return on some unsold merchandise. Virtually all distribution agreements contain an industry standard stock rotation provision allowing for minimum levels of inventory returns. In our experience, these inventory returns can usually be resold. In 2002, due to changes resulting from the merger with Elantec and other factors, we changed our revenue recognition policy for sales to domestic distributors, in which we now recognize revenue from North American distributor sales on a sell through basis. Sales made to international distributors are still recognized when product is shipped. 

 

Research and Development 

 

We believe that the continued introduction of new products in our target markets is essential to our growth. We incurred costs of $131.0 million, $106.1 million, $47.0 million and $60.3 million on internal research and development projects in the 53 weeks ended January 3, 2003, the 52 weeks ended December 28, 2001, the 26 weeks ended December 29, 2000 and the 46 weeks ended June 30, 2000, respectively. In 2002, we announced over 100 new products for our target markets. We believe that we must continue to innovate, enhance and expand our products and services to maintain our leadership position, and we intend to achieve this through in-house research and development efforts and selective investments and acquisitions. As of January 3, 2003, we had 659 employees engaged in research and development efforts. 

 

We also engage in advanced research projects with universities including the University of California in San Diego and the University of Florida. Technology and research has also been extended through selective investments in privately held emerging companies. These investments include Primarion, which is focused on next generation digital power management, and Silicon Wave, which has expertise in combining low and high data rate wireless networking technology for increased functionality. 

 

Manufacturing 

 

We manufacture products using our own fabrication facilities as well as external foundry companies which produce products to our specifications. Our internal facilities are located in Palm Bay, Florida and Milpitas, California. 

 

In March 2001, we announced the closing of our factory located in Findlay, Ohio. This activity was successfully completed, on schedule, in September 2002. Four production processes were transferred to our Palm Bay, Florida facility from this location. These processes have been successfully installed and are producing products at expected volume levels.

In July 2002 as part of the acquisition of Elantec, we announced the closing of our fabrication facility in Milpitas, California. This activity, as well as the transfer of our operational amplifier/DSL production process to our Palm Bay facility, is on schedule to be completed by July 2003. 

 

We manufacture analog semiconductors in our company-owned facilities. Our Palm Bay, Florida facility features 6 inch, 0.6 micron processing capability utilizing an extensive set of manufacturing processes to fabricate our products including technologies such as: BiCMOS, Power BiCMOS, High Frequency Bipolar and CMOS. We outsource complex sub-micron CMOS, BiCMOS and Silicon Germanium manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), AMI Semiconductor, IBM and others. The table below sets forth certain information regarding our manufacturing facilities, products, wafer diameter and annual wafer capacity:

Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers and various chemicals and gases. We obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a just-in-time basis. Under a multi-year supply agreement with ChipPAC, Inc., or ChipPAC, their facilities are our primary provider of semiconductor assembly and test services. We augment ChipPAC’s capabilities by utilizing several other assembly and test service companies. We also have limited assembly and test capability in Palm Bay, Florida and Milpitas, California. Although supplies for the raw materials used by us are currently adequate, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. 

 

Backlog 

 

Our sales are made pursuant to purchase orders that are generally booked from one to six months in advance of delivery. Backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand, pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times. Although quantities actually purchased by customers may vary between booking and delivery to the extent customer needs or industry conditions change, our backlog has historically been a reliable indicator of our future revenues. Our backlog was $120.8 million at December 28, 2001 and $131.3 million at January 3, 2003. We expect to ship the backlog at January 3, 2003 within six months of that date. 

 

Seasonality 

 

A significant percentage of our products are sold into the computing market. The computing marketing generally experiences weak demand in the first fiscal quarter of each year. 

 

Competition 

 

We compete in our targeted markets on the basis of technical performance, product features, product system compatibility, customized design, price, availability, quality and sales and technical support. Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including successful and timely development of new products and manufacturing processes, product performance and quality, manufacturing yields, product availability, intellectual property protection obtained by us and our competitors, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends.

Trademarks and Patents 

 

We own rights to a number of trademarks and patents that are important to our business. Among others, we consider Intersil, Elantec™, PRISM®, Endura™ and CommLink™ to be trademarks that are material to our operations. 

 

Our corporate policy is to protect proprietary products by obtaining patents for these products when practicable. We currently possess over 1,300 patents and have approximately 533 patents pending. 

 

Employees 

 

Our worldwide workforce consisted of 2,062 employees (full- and part-time) as of January 3, 2003. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

 

Environmental Matters 

 

Our operations are subject to environmental laws in the countries in which we operate. The regulations govern, among other things, air and water emissions at our manufacturing facilities; the management and disposal of hazardous substances; and the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination. As with other companies in our business, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities and claims. We believe, however, that our operations are substantially in compliance with applicable environmental requirements. Our costs to comply with environmental regulations were about $4.3 million, $2.6 million and $2.1 million in each of fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. 

 

The Harris Corporation facilities in Palm Bay, Florida, are listed on the National Priorities List, or NPL, for groundwater clean up under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liabilities Act, or Superfund. Our adjacent facility is included in the listing since they were owned by Harris at the time of the listing. Remediation activities associated with the NPL site have ceased. However, Harris is still obligated to conduct groundwater monitoring on our property for an unspecified period of time. Harris has indemnified us from any environmental liabilities associated with this contamination. 

 

Our former facility in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which we sold to ChipPAC in June 2000, has known groundwater contamination from past operations. The contamination was discovered in May 2000, during the closure activities associated with a former waste storage pad. This contamination has been attributed to activities conducted prior to our acquisition of the facility from Harris. Harris is conducting additional investigations and some remediation may be required. Harris has indemnified us from any environmental liabilities associated with this contamination. 

 

Also, an industrial wastewater treatment plant at our former facility in Kuala Lumpur did not have sufficient hydraulic capacity to effectively treat the wastewater flows associated with the level of production at the time of the sale to ChipPAC. We have offered and are continuing to negotiate a cash settlement for upgrading the industrial wastewater treatment plant.

Our former facility in Mountaintop, Pennsylvania, which we sold to Fairchild Semiconductor in February 2001, has known groundwater and subsurface contamination from past operations, all of which occurred prior to our acquisition of those facilities from Harris. Some remediation has been conducted and additional remediation may be required. Also, the fluoride pretreatment plant for industrial wastewater, which was installed by Harris in 1995, is not operating to design specifications and this occasionally causes discharges to the local sanitary authority that exceed pretreatment standards. Harris has conducted pilot studies and prepared a preliminary design to address the system’s deficiencies and local discharge requirements. 

 

Harris has agreed to indemnify us for the cost of addressing environmental conditions created prior to our ownership of these facilities. We agreed to a similar indemnity with ChipPAC regarding the Malaysia facility and with Fairchild Semiconductor regarding the Pennsylvania facility. Based on the historical costs of these projects and previous experience with other remediation activities, we do not believe that the future cleanup costs will be material. 

 

Future laws or regulations and changes in the existing environmental laws or regulations may subject our operations to different, additional or more stringent standards. While historically the cost of compliance with environmental laws has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, we cannot predict with certainty our future costs of compliance because of changing standards and requirements. We cannot be certain that materials costs will not be incurred in connection with the future compliance with environmental laws or with future cleanup costs related to currently unknown contamination.
