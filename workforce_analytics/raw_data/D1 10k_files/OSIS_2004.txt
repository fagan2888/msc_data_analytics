ITEM 1.    BUSINESS    

 

General 

 

OSI Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries is a vertically integrated, worldwide provider of security and inspection systems, medical monitoring and imaging systems, and optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems. Our company was incorporated in 1987 in California. Our principal office is located at 12525 Chadron Avenue, Hawthorne, California 90250. 

 

We design, manufacture and market security and inspection systems worldwide to end users under trade names including “Rapiscan,” “Ancore,” “PFNA,” “Eagle,” “Metor,” and “Secure.” These systems are used to inspect people, baggage, cargo, vehicles and other objects for weapons, explosives, drugs and other contraband. These systems are also used for the safe, accurate and efficient verification of cargo manifests for the purpose of assessing duties and monitoring the export and import of controlled materials. 

 

In March 2004, we significantly enhanced our medical monitoring and imaging systems activities through the acquisition of Spacelabs Medical, Inc. (“Spacelabs Medical”), a global manufacturer and distributor of patient monitoring and clinical information systems for use primarily in hospitals. Spacelabs Medical’s principal products encompass patient monitoring systems, network and connectivity solutions, ambulatory blood pressure monitors and medical data services. As a result, in the medical field, we now design, develop, manufacture, and market patient monitoring products, network connectivity solutions, ambulatory blood pressure monitors, and related services under trade names including “Spacelabs,” “Ultracare,” and “Ultraview.” We also continue to design, develop, manufacture and market arterial hemoglobin saturation monitors and sensors, including hand-held and wireless monitoring tools under trade names including “Dolphin” and “NuCat,” and peripheral bone densitometers under trade names including “DTX-200” and “DTU-One.” 

 

Our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems are used in a broad range of applications, including aerospace and defense electronics, security and inspection systems, medical diagnostics, fiber optics, telecommunications, gaming, office automation, computer peripherals and industrial automation. We design and manufacture optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems for others through original equipment manufacturer arrangements, as well as for our own security and medical equipment businesses. 

 

In fiscal year 2004, revenues from the sale of security and inspection systems amounted to $117.8 million, or approximately 48% of our revenues. Revenues from the sale of medical imaging and monitoring systems amounted to $60.7 million, or approximately 24% of our revenues. The revenues of Spacelabs Medical from March 19, 2004, the date of acquisition, amounting to $47.2 million, are included in the medical imaging and monitoring systems revenues. Revenues from the sale of optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems amounted to $68.6 million, or approximately 28% of revenues. Additional information concerning reporting segments is available in Note 14 to our financial statements. 

 

Industry Overview 

 

We sell our security and inspection systems and medical monitoring and imaging systems primarily to end-users, while we design and manufacture our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems primarily for original equipment manufacturers. 

 

Security and Inspection Systems.    A variety of technologies are currently used worldwide in security and inspection applications, including: computed tomography systems, single energy x-ray equipment, dual energy x-ray equipment, metal detectors, x-ray machines employing backscatter detection technology, trace detection

products, and cargo inspection systems using x-rays, gamma rays, or thermal neutron analysis. We believe that the market for security and inspection products will continue to be affected by the threat of terrorist incidents and by new government mandates and appropriations for security and inspection products in the United States and internationally. We also anticipate a growing market for the use of our products in non-security applications such as customs manifest verification and agricultural products inspection. 

 

In the 1970s, principally in response to civilian airline hijackings, the U.S. Government established security standards by setting guidelines for the screening of carry-on baggage for weapons. The United Nations later mandated these standards for adoption by all of its member states. We believe that to date the imposition of these standards has resulted in the installation of over 10,000 x-ray inspection systems in airports worldwide. Additionally, since 1998, the United Kingdom Department of Transport has required that the United Kingdom’s commercial airports deploy systems for 100% screening of international checked baggage. The European Civil Aviation Conference, an organization of 41 member states, has also agreed to implement 100% screening of international checked baggage in the future. 

 

In the United States, largely in response to the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 in December 1988, Congress enacted the Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1990, which, among other initiatives, directed the air transportation regulatory authorities in the U.S. to establish and implement strict security measures and to deploy advanced technologies for the detection of explosives. Then, in July 1996, in response to a White House commission report on aviation safety and security, the U.S. Government enacted additional legislation appropriating $144 million for the initial deployment of advanced security and inspection technology at major U.S. airports. 

 

The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon using hijacked airliners has since led to nation-wide shifts in transportation and facilities security policies. Shortly following these attacks, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act and integrated many U.S. security-related agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, into the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. As a result of these and other changes, sales of our security and inspection products have grown as compared to pre-September 11, 2001 levels. 

 

Worldwide trends toward increased international trade and transportation of goods and people have resulted in a growing demand for cargo, port and border inspection technologies. Projects recently installed or currently underway include system installations in Hong Kong, Jamaica, Mexico, Romania, South Korea, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. These sites contain various cargo inspection product offerings including fixed and relocatable high-energy x-ray, mobile gamma-ray, hybrid x-ray/thermo neutron analysis and pulsed fast neutron analysis scanning systems. We anticipate a growing demand from governments and commercial enterprises for increasingly sophisticated solutions to screening vehicles, trucks, ocean-going cargo, and air pallet containers. 

 

Medical Monitoring and Imaging Systems.    Though a well established market, healthcare is a rapidly growing sector of the U.S. and European economies. An aging population that is requiring a growing number of critical care beds is, in part, fueling this growth. 

 

Many factors such as a severe nationwide nursing shortage, stricter government requirements affecting the staffing and accountability, and shrinking reimbursements from health insurance organizations are forcing healthcare providers to do more with less—improving patient safety and economic efficiencies with fewer resources. Our medical monitoring and imaging systems group designs, manufactures and markets products that respond to these new economic forces by helping hospitals reduce costs while maintaining or improving the quality of care their physicians and nurses are able to deliver.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In March 2004, we significantly enhanced our medical monitoring and imaging systems activities through the acquisition of Spacelabs Medical, a global manufacturer and distributor of patient monitoring and clinical information systems for use primarily in hospitals. As a result of the Spacelabs Medical acquisition, our total number of employees increased from approximately 1,450 to approximately 2,205, or 52%. Our Spacelabs Medical subsidiary designs, manufactures and markets patient monitoring solutions for critical care, emergency and perioperative areas of the hospital, wired and wireless networks and connectivity solutions, ambulatory blood pressure monitors and medical data services, all aimed at providing caregivers with instant patient information. By making critical patient information more readily accessible both inside and outside the hospital, delays in decision-making can be reduced, length of stay can be shortened, and treatment errors can be minimized. 

 

Through our Dolphin Medical Inc. (“Dolphin Medical”) and Osteometer MediTech USA, Inc. (“Osteometer”) subsidiaries, we design, manufacture, and market next-generation pulse oximetry instruments and compatible pulse oximetry sensors as well as x-ray and ultrasound densitometers, which are used to diagnose osteoporosis as well as to provide follow-up bone density measurements. Our pulse oximetry technologies are used to non-invasively monitor oxygenation levels in a patient’s blood. 

 

Optoelectronic Devices and Value-Added Subsystems.    Our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems are used for a wide variety of applications ranging from complex monitoring, measurement and positioning functions, such as in industrial robotics where our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems are used to detect the exact position, motion or size of another object, to simple functions, such as the detection of paper in the print path of a laser printer. Because optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems can be used in a wide variety of measurement control and monitoring applications, they are used in a broad array of industrial applications and are key components in the telecommunications and fiber optics industries. 

 

We believe that in recent years, advances in technology and reductions in the cost of key components of optoelectronic systems, including computer processing power and memory, have broadened the market by enabling the use of optoelectronic devices in a greater number of applications. In addition, we see a trend among original equipment manufacturers to increasingly outsource the design and manufacture of optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems to fully-integrated, independent manufacturers, like us, who may have greater specialization, broader expertise, and the flexibility to respond in shorter time periods than most original equipment manufacturers can accomplish in-house. We believe that our level of vertical integration, substantial engineering resources, expertise in the use and application of optoelectronic technology, and low-cost international manufacturing operations enable us to compete effectively in the market for optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems. Our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems are also used in our security and inspection systems and medical monitoring and imaging products. 

 

We have also penetrated several related markets that depend on our optoelectronic device and subsystem technologies. For example, we sell a series of high-speed photodetectors for use in fiber optic systems such as Gigabit Ethernet, Fiber Channel, and other telecommunication and data communication applications. Through system engineering, product development, rapid prototyping, and volume manufacturing, we develop, manufacture and market laser-based weapons simulation systems for the defense industry. Products include tactical engagement simulation systems, man worn laser detectors, small arms transmitters, controller guns and a variety of targeting systems. We also develop, manufacture, and sell laser-based remote sensing devices that are used in agricultural and mapping applications, as well as to detect and classify vehicles in toll and traffic management systems. Finally, our optoelectronic devices and subsystems group recently added “box build” manufacturing services and PC board assembly capabilities utilizing state-of-the-art automated surface mount technology lines for use by customers in the medical electronics, automotive diagnostic electronics, telecommunications, and digital audio systems industries, among others. 

 

Growth Strategy 

 

Our primary objectives are to be a leading provider of security and inspection products, cutting-edge medical monitoring and imaging systems and specialized optoelectronic products, to enhance our position in the 

 

3 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

international inspection and detection marketplace, to capitalize on our research to provide reliable and cost-optimized medical devices, and to leverage our expertise in the optoelectronic technology industry by entering into new markets. Key elements of this strategy include: 

 

Capitalizing on the Growing Market for Security and Inspection Systems.    We believe that heightened attentiveness to terrorist and other security threats may continue to drive growth in the market for security and inspection systems, not only in transportation security, but in facilities security, event security and materials inspection as well. In addition, the trend toward increased international transportation of goods and people may result in growth in the market for cargo inspection systems. Package screening by freight forwarders also represents a potential growing sector, as new regulations in Europe require such screening, and awareness of the need for such screening grows in the U.S. We intend to continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts both domestically and internationally, and to capitalize on opportunities to replace service and upgrade existing security installations. 

 

Developing New Security and Inspection Technologies.    We intend to continue to develop new security and inspection systems such as our proprietary pulsed fast neutron analysis and real time tomography products. These and the other technological advances we make allow us to offer customers the broadest variety of advanced security solutions. In addition, through research and development and selective acquisitions, we may enhance and expand our current product offerings to better address new applications and security industry demands. 

 

Improving Existing Medical Diagnostic Technologies.    In March 2004, we significantly enhanced our medical monitoring and imaging systems activities through the acquisition of Spacelabs Medical, a global manufacturer and distributor of patient monitoring and clinical information systems for use primarily in hospitals. Spacelabs Medical develops medical monitoring and imaging systems aimed at lowering false alarm rates, thereby reducing time demands on physicians and nurses, and improving patient identification accuracy, thereby reducing physician and nursing errors. In connection with these efforts, Spacelabs Medical and our Dolphin Medical subsidiary are also pursuing cable-free medical sensors and other wireless solutions that will allow for medical monitoring, patient data, transmission, alarm notifications, and other information to be instantly transmitted at any time to any location. We also continue to improve and develop our medical diagnostic tools aimed at bone metabolic diseases, such as osteoporosis, and patient monitors and accessories that utilize pulse oximetry technologies. Overall, our efforts at improving our existing medical diagnostic technologies will continue to concentrate on the development of devices that make it possible for institutions from large hospitals to small clinics and physicians’ offices to obtain accurate, precise, reliable and cost-effective results. 

 

Leveraging the Optoelectronic Design and Manufacturing Expertise to Address New Applications.    We believe that one of our primary competitive strengths is our expertise in designing and manufacturing, at cost-effective rates, specialized optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems for our own end products both in security and medical businesses and for the products of our original equipment manufacturer customers. Our optoelectronic devices and subsystems group currently designs and manufactures devices and subsystems for numerous customers serving hundreds of applications. 

 

Acquiring New Companies and Technologies.    We have developed expertise in our various lines of business and other areas through internal research and development efforts and also through selective acquisitions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

acquisition costs. Spacelabs Medical is a leading global manufacturer and distributor of patient monitoring systems for critical care and anesthesia, wired and wireless networks, clinical information connectivity solutions, ambulatory blood pressure monitors, and medical data services. These are areas in which we have considerable interest as they represent a natural extension of our engineering and manufacturing expertise and will add to our presence in the medical device industry. The installed base of Spacelabs Medical’s patient monitoring systems consists of approximately 100,000 units worldwide, with 60,000 in the United States, 30,000 in Europe and 10,000 in Asia. In June 2004, we notified Instrumentarium Corporation’s parent, GE Medical Systems, of a working capital and retention bonus adjustment resulting in what we believe to be a downward adjustment of the purchase price in the amount of $25.9 million. In September 2004, GE Medical Systems responded that it believes the amount of the downward adjustments to be approximately $7.8 million. No amounts have been recorded in the financial statements in relation to the expected reduction in the purchase price. The amount of the final adjustment will be resolved by way of a process established in the purchase agreement. 

 

Capitalizing on Vertical Integration.    Our vertical integration provides several advantages in our security and inspection, medical monitoring and imaging and optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystem product lines. These advantages include reduced manufacturing and delivery times, lower costs due to our access to competitive international labor markets, direct sourcing of raw materials and quality control. We also believe that we offer significant added value to our original equipment manufacturer customers by providing a full range of vertically-integrated services including component design and customization, subsystem concept design and application engineering, product prototyping and development, efficient pre-production, and short-run and high volume manufacturing. We believe that our vertical integration differentiates us from many of our competitors and provides value to our original equipment manufacturer customers who can rely on us to be an integrated supplier of optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems. We intend to continue to leverage our vertically integrated services to create greater value for our customers in the design and manufacture of our products. We believe that this strategy better positions us for penetration into other end markets. 

 

 

Capitalizing on Global Presence.    We operate from locations in North America, Europe and Asia. We view our international operations as providing an important strategic advantage over competitors in each of the security inspection, medical monitoring and imaging systems, and optoelectronic devices and subsystems market for three primary reasons. First, international manufacturing facilities allow us to take advantage of competitive labor rates in order to be a low cost producer. Second, our international offices strengthen our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to service and repair our systems by providing direct access to growing foreign markets and to our existing international customer base. Third, multiple manufacturing locations allow us to reduce delivery times to our global customer base. In the future, we intend to develop new sources of manufacturing and sales capabilities to maintain and enhance the benefits of our international presence. 

 

Selectively Entering New Markets.    We intend to selectively enter new markets that complement our existing capabilities in the design, development and manufacture of security systems, medical products, and optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems. We believe that by manufacturing other end products that rely on our existing technological capabilities, we will leverage our integrated design and manufacturing infrastructure to capture greater margins and to build a larger presence in those new end markets that present attractive competitive dynamics. We intend to achieve this strategy through internal growth and through selective acquisitions of end-product manufacturers. 

 

Products and Technology 

 

We design, develop, manufacture and sell products ranging from complex security and inspection systems to medical imaging and monitoring systems to discrete optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems. 

 

Security and Inspection Systems.    We design, manufacture and market security and inspection systems worldwide to end users under trade names including “Rapiscan,” “Ancore,” “PFNA,” “Eagle,” “Metor,” and “Secure.” These products are used to inspect people, baggage, cargo, vehicles and other objects for weapons, 

 

7 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

explosives, drugs and other contraband. These systems are also used for the safe, accurate and efficient verification of cargo manifests for the purpose of assessing duties and monitoring the export and import of controlled materials. 

 

In recent years, and especially after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, security and inspection products have increasingly been used at a wide range of facilities other than airports. Moreover, the non-security use of such equipment, such as manifest verification by customs agencies at border crossings, or agricultural products inspection, has also grown. As a result of the additional markets, we have successfully diversified sales channels for our security and inspection products. Of our security and inspection revenues, the percentage derived from the sale of inspection products to airlines and airports was approximately 24.5% in fiscal year 2002, 28.8% in fiscal year 2003 and 16.5 % in fiscal year 2004, and the balance of such revenues were derived from all other sales. 

 

Many of our inspection and detection products combine the use of x-ray technology with our optoelectronic capabilities. Such products include dual- or multi-energy x-ray technology with computer enhanced imaging technology to facilitate the detection of materials such as explosives, narcotics, currency or other contraband. While all x-ray systems produce a two-dimensional image of the contents of the inspected object, the dual-energy x-ray systems also measure the x-ray absorption of the inspected object’s contents at two x-ray energies to determine the atomic number, mass and other characteristics of the object’s contents. The various organic and non-organic substances in the inspected object appear to operators of the inspection systems in various colors and this visual information can be used to identify and differentiate the inspected materials. These inspection systems range in size from compact tabletop systems to large cargo, port and border inspection systems comprising entire buildings through which trucks, shipping containers or pallets are transported. 

 

Some of our inspection products require an operator to monitor the images produced by the inspection equipment. Depending on the model, our products permit the operator to inspect the contents of packages at varying image modes and magnifications. The images range from the monochrome and pseudo-color images produced by single energy x-ray imaging systems, to high resolution, multi-color images produced by our computer enhanced dual-energy models. We believe that our Rapiscan 500 and 600 series machines provide one of the highest quality images currently available in the x-ray security and inspection industry. 

 

We also manufacture inspection products that automatically and non-invasively detect explosives and other contraband through the use of pulsed fast neutron and thermal neutron technologies. Such technologies permit the operator to inspect cargo, vehicles, and small parcels based on the distinctive chemical composition of various forms of contraband. Our Pulsed Fast Neutron Analysis (“PFNA”) systems use a penetrating beam of fast neutrons to measure the elemental contents (oxygen, nitrogen, etc.) within scanned objects (cargo containers, trucks, etc.) and identify elemental signatures of explosives, drugs or other contraband. The PFNA system then displays to the system operator a three-dimensional image of the scanned object, identifying the location and type of contraband found. Our Thermal Neutron Analysis systems use a similar technology to detect bulk quantities of explosives and drugs concealed in trucks or cargo containers. 

 

Our cargo, vehicle, port, and border screening applications utilize high-energy x-ray as well as gamma-ray and neutron technologies along with computer-enhanced imaging. Such cargo inspection product configurations currently include fixed-site, relocatable, rail, and mobile systems. These products are primarily used to verify the contents of trucks or cargo containers, and to detect the presence of contraband. They offer significant improvements over past methods of cargo screening, such as manual searches, as our cargo systems are faster, more thorough, and do not subject the cargo to pilferage. Entire shipping containers or trucks can be screened in seconds. 

 

Our cargo inspection systems currently include fixed site, relocatable, and mobile systems. Fixed-site systems consist of a permanent structure in which trucks or containers are subjected to high-energy x-ray, gamma-ray, or neutron inspection. Fixed site projects installed or currently under construction include systems in the United States, Hong Kong, Mexico, and Taiwan. Relocatable systems use similar technologies, but consist of 

 

8 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

structures that can be relocated among pre-positioned pads. Several relocatable systems were recently delivered to the Korean Customs Service. Mobile systems are truck-mounted systems using high-energy x-ray or gamma-ray for the inspection of vehicles or cargo containers. The mobile systems can be quickly deployed where needed. Mobile systems have been sold or are currently under production for customers including government agencies in the United States, Malaysia, and Romania. 

 

Our security and inspection systems group also offers a line of walk-through metal detection and hand-held examination products for screening people in airports, amusement parts, banks, courthouses, government buildings, sports arenas, and other venues. Our walk-through metal detection systems utilize pulse induced magnetic fields combined with microprocessor based electronics, which provide uniform detection of ferrous and non-ferrous metallic objects. The technologies range from dual-channel crossed magnetic fields to multi-zone coil configurations. Our “Secure” brand product line, also for hands-off examination, uses extremely low dose backscatter x-ray imaging to detect contraband and weapons concealed underneath clothing and hair. The system provides enhance screening compared to metal detectors as it displays anomalies caused by very small amounts of metal as well as non-metallic items. As a result, our “Secure” products can simultaneously locate and detect conventional metal weapons, as well as ceramic knives, explosives, illicit drugs, precious metals, cameras, recording devices and other contraband or security threats. 

 

The following table sets forth certain information related to the standard security and inspection products that we currently offer. We do, however, also customize our standard products to suit specific applications and customer requirements:

Medical Monitoring and Imaging Systems.    In the medical field, we design, develop, manufacture, and market patient monitoring systems, network connectivity solutions, ambulatory blood pressure monitors, and related services under trade names including “Spacelabs,” “Ultracare” and “Ultraview.” We also design, develop, manufacture and market arterial hemoglobin saturation monitors and sensors, including hand-held and wireless monitoring tools under trade names including “Dolphin” and “NuCat” and peripheral bone densitometers under trade names including “DTX-200” and “DTU-One.” 

 

Our “Ultraview” patient monitors are used in perioperative, critical care and emergency ward environments. We also offer patient monitors for virtually all applications in the hospital, including neonatal, pediatric and adult critical and emergency care, as well as anesthesia and sub-acute care. WinDNA, based on Citrix application server technology, is a feature of many of these products which allows clinicians to view and control Microsoft

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows applications on the patient monitor’s display, eliminating the need for separate terminals in the patient’s room. Attending nurses can thereby check laboratory results and other reports, enter orders, review protocols, and do charting right at the patient’s bedside. Inputs can be made using a mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen. 

 

For electrocardiograph monitoring or multiparameter monitoring of ambulatory patients, we offer a digital telemetry system. The system operates between 608 and 614 MHz, a band not used for private land mobile radio, business radio services or broadcast analog and digital television. The “Ultraview” Digital Telemetry solution comprises a lightweight and compact transmitter that enables monitoring of heart rate, ST segment, arrhythmia and continuous SpO2 (Pulse Oximetry). The multiparameter transmitter also integrates with our “Ultralite” ambulatory blood pressure monitor for the transmission of non-invasive blood pressure values to a central station or a multi-disclosure and information system. 

 

We are also a world leader in ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, which is a routine procedure in many European countries and is increasingly being used in the United States. Many physicians are using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to detect “white coat” hypertension, a condition in which people experience elevated blood pressure in the doctor’s office but not in their daily lives. Hypertension affects approximately 50 million Americans and is particularly prevalent in the Medicare population. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is also used to adjust drug therapies for hypertensive patients. It is estimated that as many as 20% of the persons diagnosed with hypertension based on blood pressure measurements taken in their physicians’ offices are not actually hypertensive. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring helps improve diagnostic accuracy and minimize the associated costs of treatment. 

 

Our medical monitoring and imaging systems group also manufactures and distributes the “DTX-200”, a dual energy x-ray forearm densitometer, which is used to diagnose osteoporosis as well as to provide follow-up bone density measurements and the “DTU-One”, a calcaneus ultrasound scanner. The “DTU-One” is the first commercially available ultrasound scanner using imaging capability for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. 

 

We develop next-generation pulse oximetry instruments and compatible pulse oximetry sensors under the “Dolphin One” product line. “Dolphin One” products include the “Voyager”, “Dolphin 2100” and “Dolphin 2150”. The Voyager is the first personal data assistant-based pulse oximetry product on the market. Our medical monitoring and imaging systems group also manufactures and distributes, under the “Dolphin 2000”, “Aristo” and “NuCat” product lines, sensors that are compatible with products made by other manufacturers of pulse oximetry technologies. 

 

Finally, we believe that a substantial market exists for disposable supplies such as patient electrodes, specialty graph paper, sensors and connecting lead wires that are used with medical devices. As a result, we sell a broad line of such supplies as an adjunct to our medical device sales. In most cases, these products are obtained from original equipment manufacturers and are manufactured to our specifications.

Optoelectronic Devices and Value-Added Subsystems.    Optoelectronic devices generally consist of both active and passive components. Active components sense light of varying wavelengths and convert the light detected into electronic signals, whereas passive components amplify, separate or reflect light. The active components we manufacture consist of silicon, Gallium Arsenide, and Indium Gallium Arsenide photodetectors. Passive components include lenses, prisms, filters, mirrors and other precision optical products that are used by us in the manufacture of our optoelectronic products or are sold to others for use in telescopes, laser printers, copiers, microscopes and other detection and vision equipment. The devices we manufacture are both standard products and products customized for specific applications and are offered either as components or as subsystems. 

 

In addition to the manufacture of standard and original equipment manufacturer products, we also specialize in designing and manufacturing customized optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems for use in a wide range of products and equipment. An optoelectronic subsystem typically consists of one or more optoelectronic devices that are combined with other electronic components and packaging for use in an end product. The composition of a subsystem can range from a simple assembly of various optoelectronic devices that are incorporated into other subsystems (for example, a printed circuit board containing our optoelectronic devices) to complete end-products (for example, medical pulse oximeter probes that we manufacture and package on behalf of an original equipment manufacturer customer and then ship directly to the customer or the customer’s distributors). We manufacture subsystems for a variety of applications, such as fiber optics, imaging electronics for medical CT scanners, disposable and reusable medical probes for use with medical pulse oximetry equipment, components and subsystems for laser gyroscopes used in military and commercial aviation, optoelectronic subsystems for slot machines, laser subsystems in military helicopter gun sighting equipment, positioning subassemblies for computer peripheral equipment, alignment subsystems for laser heads in optical disc drives, and detection subsystems for submarines.

We have recently developed two-dimensional back-illuminated detector technology for security, medical, and other industrial applications. This technology overcomes the limitations of conventional detectors by providing finer detector pitch density. We expect that this technology will be used in high-resolution multi-slice CT scanners and other applications requiring improved image resolution. 

 

Markets, Customers and Applications 

 

Security and Inspection Products.    Since entering the security and inspection products market in 1993, we have shipped over 10,000 x-ray systems and over 40,000 metal detectors to over 75 countries. The following is a representative list of certain customers and/or installations that have purchased our security and inspection products:

The market for most security and inspection products developed in response to civilian airline hijackings. Consequently, a significant portion of our security and inspection products was sold and continues to be sold for use at airports. Recently, however, our security and inspection products have been used for security purposes at locations in addition to airports, such as courthouses, office buildings, mailrooms, schools, prisons and high-profile locations such as Buckingham Palace, the Kremlin, and the Vatican. In addition, our security and inspection products are increasingly being used for non-security purposes, such as for cargo inspection to detect narcotics and contraband and to verify manifests, prevention of pilferage at semiconductor manufacturing facilities, quality assurance, and the detection of gold and currency. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon using hijacked airliners likely will continue to cause increasing levels of airport security measures, which have resulted in an increase in sales of our security and inspection products as compared to previous levels. 

 

In September 1998, we entered into an agreement with what was then known as the Federal Aviation Administration, now the Transportation Security Administration, for advanced contraband detection systems with threat image projection features. The systems began to ship to Category X airports (designated due to their high security priority) in the United States during fiscal year 1999. Systems were shipped each year since fiscal year 2000 and will continue to be shipped during fiscal year 2005. In addition, the Transportation Security Administration ordered Rapiscan shoe scanning x-ray technology to supplement airport checkpoint screening. 

 

In April 2000, the U.S. Government awarded us a contract to provide x-ray screening systems at selected airports throughout the United States. Under the contract, the U.S. Government has the right to purchase from us 

 

13 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

up to 800 systems, for which the aggregate purchase price would be approximately $40 million. In fiscal years 2001 through 2004 our installed-base totaled approximately 750 systems under this contract. We expect to ship additional systems during fiscal year 2005. 

 

Since 2001, we have completed the delivery of fixed site, relocatable, or mobile cargo inspection systems to governments and government agencies in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Romania, South Korea, Taiwan, and other locations. 

 

Medical Monitoring and Imaging Systems.    Our medical monitoring and imaging systems are manufactured and distributed globally for use in critical care, emergency and perioperative areas within hospitals. We also provide wired and wireless networks and clinical information access solutions, ambulatory blood pressure monitors and medical data services. Our Spacelabs Medical subsidiary has an installed base of approximately 100,000 patient monitoring units and 30,000 ambulatory blood pressure monitors worldwide. Our medical monitoring and imaging systems business has distributors in over 70 countries and subsidiary or branch offices in the United States and internationally in Austria, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy, Singapore, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom. 

 

In March 2004, our medical monitoring and imaging systems group was awarded a contract to supply over 100 monitors to the Chi Mei Liu-Ying hospital in Liu-Ying, Taiwan. Chi Mei Liu-Ying is a branch hospital located approximately 60 kilometers from Chi Mei main hospital. The contract was awarded to us, in part, because our monitoring systems allowed these two hospitals to easily share data and information between their sites. 

 

In June of 2004 we were awarded a contract to become the major supplier of patient monitoring equipment for the Shanghai SARS Center in Shanghai, China. The center is a new, approximately 500-bed facility, that will serve as a reference standard for communicable disease control hospitals engaged in the treatment and monitoring of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) cases in China. 

 

Also in June 2004, Spartanburg Regional Medical Center, located in Spartanburg, South Carolina, agreed to standardize its institution-wide patient monitoring equipment with our monitors as part of its ongoing commitment to patient care and safety. The new monitors, which can be customized for each patient’s needs, will enable clinicians to securely access live patient data when and where they need it. This means clinicians will be able to obtain a complete patient profile, including other information available through the central information system such as lab and radiology reports, and medical records, from multiple sources without leaving the patient.

Marketing, Sales and Service 

 

We market and sell our security and inspection products worldwide through a direct sales and marketing staff of approximately 60 employees located in the United States, Canada, Finland, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, in addition to a global network of independent sales representatives. This sales staff is supported by a service organization of approximately 90 persons located primarily in the United States, Finland, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom and a global network of independent distributors. We also support these sales and customer relations efforts by providing operator training, computerized training and testing equipment, in-country service, software upgrades, service training for customer technicians and a newsletter on security issues. 

 

We market and sell and our medical monitoring and imaging products through a direct sales and marketing staff of approximately 225 sales personnel and 170 service personnel worldwide located in the United States, Austria, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Singapore, in addition to a global network of 

 

15 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

independent distributors. We also support these sales and customer service efforts by providing operator in service training, software updates and upgrades, and service training for customer biomedical staff and distributors. 

 

We market and sell our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems, through both a direct sales and marketing staff of approximately 25 employees located in the United States, Singapore, Malaysia, and Norway and indirectly through a global network of independent sales representatives and distributors. Most of our in-house sales staff is based in the United States while most of our independent sales representatives and distributors are located abroad. This sales staff is supported by an applications engineering group whose members are available to provide technical support. This support includes designing applications, providing custom tooling and process integration, defining solutions for customers and developing products that meet customer defined specifications. 

 

We consider our maintenance service operations to be an important element of our business. After the expiration of our standard product warranty periods, we are sometimes engaged by our customers to provide maintenance services for our security and inspection products through annual maintenance contracts. We provide a variety of service and support options for our medical monitoring and imaging systems customers, ranging from complete on-site repair and maintenance service and telephone support to parts exchange programs for customers with the internal expertise to perform a portion of their own service needs. We believe that our international maintenance service capabilities allow us to be competitive in selling our security and inspection products as well as our medical monitoring and imaging products. Furthermore, we believe that as our installed base of both our security and inspection and medical monitoring and imaging products increase, revenues generated from such annual maintenance service contracts and from the sale of replacement parts will increase. 

 

Research and Development 

 

Our security and inspection systems are designed at our facilities in Hawthorne, Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale, California and internationally in Finland, Malaysia, India and the United Kingdom. These products include mechanical, electrical, electronic, digital electronic and software subsystems, which are all designed by us. In addition to product design, we provide system integration services to integrate our products into turnkey systems at the customer site. We support cooperative research projects with government agencies and, on occasion, provide contract research for our customers and government agencies. 

 

Our medical monitoring and imaging systems are designed and engineered at our facilities in Issaquah, Washington while our medical diagnostic and imaging systems are designed and engineered at our facilities in Hawthorne, California. Such systems include mechanical, electrical, digital electronic and software subsystems, all of which are designed by us. We are also currently involved, both in the U.S. and abroad, in several research projects aimed at improving our medical systems and at expanding our current product line. 

 

Our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems are primarily designed and engineered at our facilities in Camarillo, Hawthorne, Newbury Park, and Upland, California, Orlando, Florida, and Ocean Springs, Mississippi and internationally in India, Malaysia, and Norway. We engineer and manufacture subsystems to solve the specific application needs of our original equipment manufacturer customers. In addition, we offer entire subsystem design and manufacturing solutions. We consider our engineering personnel to be an important extension of our core sales and marketing efforts. 

 

In addition to close collaboration with our customers in the design and development of our current products, we maintain an active program for the development and introduction of new products, enhancements and improvements to our existing products, including the implementation of new applications of our technology. We seek to further enhance our research and development program and consider such program to be an important element of our business and operations. As of June 30, 2003, in addition to the engineers that we employed in 

 

16 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

manufacturing, process design and applications development, we engaged approximately 255 full-time engineers, technicians and support staff in research and development. During fiscal year 2002, our research and development expenses were $6.4 million, in 2003 they were $8.9 million, in 2004 they were $14.6 million. The increase in 2004 reflects increased research and development spending for our security and inspection side of our business and inclusion of research and development expenses of our recent acquisitions of Spacelabs Medical and OSI Laserscan. In order to fulfill our strategy of enhancing our security and inspection product lines and of improving the capabilities of our existing products, we intend to continue to invest in our research and development efforts in the future. 

 

Manufacturing and Materials Management 

 

We currently have manufacturing facilities for our security and inspection systems in Hawthorne, Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale California and internationally in Canada, Finland, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. We have manufacturing facilities for our medical monitoring and imaging systems in Hawthorne, California and Issaquah, Washington and internationally in India, Malaysia, and Singapore. We have manufacturing facilities for our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems in Camarillo, Hawthorne, Newbury Park, and Upland, California and Ocean Springs, Mississippi and internationally in Malaysia, Singapore, and Norway. Our principal manufacturing facility is in Hawthorne, California. However, most of our high volume, labor intensive manufacturing and assembly is performed at our facility in Malaysia. Since most of our customers currently are located in Asia, Europe and the United States, our ability to assemble products in these markets and provide follow-on service from offices located in these regions is an important component of our global strategy. 

 

Our global manufacturing organization has expertise in optoelectronic, microelectronic, and integrated value-added assemblies for commercial, medical, aerospace, and defense industry applications. Our manufacturing includes silicon wafer processing and fabrication, optoelectronic device assembly and screening, thin and thick film microelectronic hybrid assemblies, and surface mounted and thru-hole PCB electronic assemblies, and value-added services including complete turn-key and box-build manufacturing. We outsource certain manufacturing operations including our sheet metal fabrication and certain plastic components. The manufacturing process for components and subsystems consists of manual tasks performed by skilled and semi-skilled workers as well as automated tasks. 

 

The principal raw materials and subcomponents used in producing our security and inspection systems consist primarily of x-ray generators, linear accelerators, detectors, data acquisition and computing devices, conveyor systems and video monitors. Substantially all of the optoelectronic devices, subsystems, and circuit card assemblies used in our inspection and detection systems are manufactured in-house. The x-ray generators used in our passenger and baggage screening inspection and detection systems are also manufactured in-house, while the x-ray generators and linear accelerators used in our large cargo screening inspection and detection systems are purchased from unaffiliated third party providers. We purchase the metal enclosures of the x-ray systems, x-ray tubes, computer hardware and certain standard mechanical parts from unaffiliated third party providers. 

 

The principal raw materials and subcomponents used in producing our medical monitoring and imaging systems consist of printed circuit boards, housings, cables, filters and packaging materials. We purchase certain devices, including computers, peripheral accessories and remote displays from unaffiliated third party providers. 

 

The principal raw materials and subcomponents used in producing our optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems consist of silicon wafers, ceramics, electronic subcomponents, light emitting diodes, phototransistors, printed circuit boards, headers and caps, housings, cables, filters and packaging materials. The silicon-based optoelectronic devices manufactured by us are critical components in most of our subsystems. Since 1987, we have purchased substantially all of the silicon wafers we use to manufacture our optoelectronic devices from Wacker Siltronic Corp. 

 

17 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although to date none of our groups has experienced any significant shortages or material delays in obtaining any of its raw materials or subcomponents, there can be no assurance that they will not face such shortages or delays in one or more materials in the future. For cost, quality control and efficiency reasons, we generally purchase raw materials and subcomponents only from single vendors with whom we have ongoing relationships. We do, however, qualify second sources for most of our raw materials and critical components, or have identified alternate sources of supply. We purchase the materials pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Although to date we have not experienced any significant shortages or material delays in obtaining any of our raw materials or subcomponents, there can be no assurance that we will not face such shortages or delays in one or more of these materials in the future. 

 

Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses 

 

Trademarks. We have used, registered, and applied to register certain trademarks and service marks to distinguish our products, technologies and services from those of our competitors in the U.S. and in foreign countries. We enforce our trademark, service mark, and trade name rights in the U.S. and abroad. 

 

Patents. We hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents relating to various aspects of our security and inspection products, medical imaging and monitoring systems, and optoelectronic devices and subsystems. Our current patents will expire at various times between 2006 and 2021. There can be no assurance that pending patent applications or other applications that may be filed will result in issued patents, or that any issued patents will survive challenges to their validity. Although we believe that our patents have value, there can be no assurance that our patents, or any additional patents that may be issued in the future, will provide meaningful protection from competition. 

 

Licenses. In June 1999, as part of an arbitration settlement, we entered into a fully paid-up, nonexclusive patent license agreement with PerkinElmer, Inc., formerly known as EG&G, Inc. (“EG&G”) for U.S. Patent No. 4,366,382. The patent expired in September 2000. Subsequent to the end of the patent term, we have been free to use the technology without patent or license restriction. Under the license, for which we paid $450,000, we were permitted to make, use and sell or otherwise dispose of security and inspection products that use an x-ray line scan system for baggage inspection purposes covered by EG&G’s patent. 

 

In December 1998, as part of the settlement of certain litigation, we and Lunar Corporation (“Lunar”) entered into a license agreement pursuant to which we were granted a fully paid up worldwide, nonexclusive license under U.S. Patent Nos. 4,626,688 (the “688 patent”) and 5,138,167 (the “167 patent”) in the non-medical field. Prior to our acquisition of Osteometer in September 1998, Osteometer had also been involved in litigation with Lunar regarding the 688 and 167 patents. In December 1998, the parties to this litigation entered into a settlement agreement. As a part of the settlement, the parties entered into a license agreement pursuant to which Osteometer was granted a worldwide, nonexclusive license under the 688 and 167 patents for certain bone densitometers. We make royalty payments on sales of the licensed products. 

 

We believe that our patents, trademarks, and licenses are important to our business. The loss of some of our patents, trademarks, or licenses might have a negative impact; however, we operate in a competitive environment with a known customer base and rely mainly on providing value for money with quality products and services to ensure continuing business.

Environmental Regulations 

 

We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, and disposal of certain hazardous substances and wastes used or generated in the manufacturing and assembly of our products. Under such laws, we may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances that have been or are being released on or in our facilities or that have been or are being disposed of off site as waste. Such laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of such hazardous substances. We have conducted Phase I environmental site assessments for each of our properties in the United States at which we manufacture products. The purpose of each such report is to identify, as of the date of such report, potential sources of contamination of the property from past and present activities or from nearby operations. In certain cases, we have conducted further environmental assessments consisting of soil and groundwater testing and other investigations deemed appropriate by independent environmental consultants. We believe that we are currently in compliance with all material environmental regulations in connection with our manufacturing operations, and that we have obtained all material environmental permits necessary to conduct our business. The amount of hazardous substances and wastes produced and generated by us may increase in the future depending on changes in our operations. Any failure by us to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing process or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

 

During one such investigation, we discovered soil and groundwater contamination at our Hawthorne, California facility. We filed the requisite reports concerning this problem with the appropriate environmental authorities in fiscal year 2001. We have not yet received any response to such reports, and no agency action or litigation is presently pending or threatened. We also have notified the prior owners of the facility and the present owners and tenants of adjacent properties concerning the problem and have requested from such parties agreements to toll of the statute of limitations with respect to actions against such parties with respect to the contamination in order that we may focus our attention on resolution of the contamination problem. Our site was previously used for semiconductor manufacturing similar to that presently conducted on the site by us, and it is not presently known who is responsible for the contamination and the remediation. The groundwater contamination is a known regional problem, not limited to our premises or our immediate surroundings. 

 

We recently were informed of soil and groundwater remediation efforts at a facility that our Ferson Optics subsidiary previously leased in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. Ferson Optics occupied the facility until October 2003. We believe that the owner and previous occupants of the facility have primary responsibility for such remediation and have an agreement with the facility’s owner under which the owner is responsible for remediation of pre-existing conditions. However, we are unable at this time to ascertain whether Ferson Optics bears any exposure for remediation costs under statutes or regulations. 

 

Competition 

 

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by evolving customer needs and rapid technological change. We compete with a number of other manufacturers, some of which have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. In addition, these competitors may have the ability to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements, have stronger customer relationships, have greater name recognition, and may devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against any current or future competitors in the security and inspection systems, medical imaging and monitoring, or optoelectronic devices and subsystems markets or, that future competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. 

 

In the security and inspection market, competition is based primarily on such factors as product performance, functionality and quality, the overall cost effectiveness of the system, prior customer relationships, 

 

19 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

technological capabilities of the products, price, local market presence, and breadth of sales and service organization. We believe that our principal competitors in the market for security and inspection products are the Security and Detection Systems division of L-3 Communications Corporation, the Smiths Detection division of Smiths Group plc, American Science and Engineering, Inc., Science Applications International Corporation, Control Screening L.L.C., CEIA SpA, Garrett Electronics, Inc., and Nuctech Company Limited. Competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins, and loss of our market share. In the airline and airport security and inspection market, particularly in the upgrade and replacement market, we also compete for potential customers based on existing relationships between our competitors and the customers. Certain of our competitors have been manufacturing inspection systems since the 1980s and have established strong relationships with airlines and airport authorities. We believe that the image quality and resolution of certain of our security and inspection products is superior to the image quality offered by most of our competitors’ x-ray based inspection products. Additionally, our true multi-zone metal detection technology provides the ability to detect small metallic objects and offer higher levels of discrimination in weapons-screening applications. Although we also have established relationships with a number of airport and airline customers, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete in the future with existing competitors or with new entrants. In the large cargo inspection systems market, we compete for potential customers based on price, performance and the ability to design both standard and customized products. Several of our competitors have operated in this area for longer than we have. However, due to our recent successes in designing and delivering high-energy x-ray systems, we believe we have demonstrated our ability to compete effectively. Additionally, although our competitors in the large cargo inspection market each offer products in competition with one or more of our products, our ability to supply high-energy x-ray, gamma-ray, pulsed fast neutron analysis, and thermal neutron analysis systems means that we offer among the widest array of solutions available from a single supplier. 

 

In the patient monitoring and imaging systems market, competition is also based on a variety of factors including product performance, functionality, value, and breadth of sales and service organization. We believe that our principal competitors in the market for patient monitoring and imaging systems are Criticare Systems, Inc., Philips Medical Systems, GE Medical Systems, Drägerwerk AG, Datascope Corp., Nihon Kohden Corporation and Nellcor, a division of Tyco International, Inc. Competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins, and loss of our market share. We believe that our patient monitoring products are easier to use than the products of many of our competitors because we offer a consistent user interface throughout many of our product lines. Furthermore, the monitors of our Spacelabs Medical subsidiary are backward/forward compatible, meaning that new Spacelabs Medical monitors can interface with existing Spacelabs Medical monitor models, thus offering investment protection to our customers. While some of our competitors are just now introducing portal technology, which allows remote access to data from the bedside monitor, central station or other point of care, we believe that our version is superior in bringing instant access to labs, radiology and charting at the point of care. Although we have established relationships with a number of large hospitals, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete in the future with existing competitors or with new entrants. 

 

In the optoelectronic devices and subsystems market, competition for optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems is based primarily on such factors as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices, product quality, timeliness of delivery, price, customer technical support, and on the ability to provide fully integrated services from application development and design through production. We believe that our major competitors in the optoelectronic device and subsystem market are PerkinElmer, Inc. and Hamamatsu Corporation. Because we specialize in custom subsystems requiring a high degree of engineering expertise, we believe that we generally do not compete to any significant degree with any other large United States, European or Asian manufacturers of standard optoelectronic components. 

 

Backlog 

 

We measure our backlog as orders for which purchase orders or contracts have been signed, but which have not yet been shipped and for which revenues have not yet been recognized. We typically ship our security and 

 

20 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

inspection products, optoelectronic devices and value-added subsystems, and medical imaging and monitoring systems within one to several months after receiving an order. However, such shipments may be delayed for a variety of reasons including any special design or engineering requirements of the customer. In addition, large orders (more than ten machines) of security and inspection products typically require more lead-time. 

 

Large cargo scanning machines may require several months to several years lead-time. The only significant shipping delays we have experienced are with large cargo scanners. Such delays for many reasons, including: (i) additional time necessary to conduct large cargo system inspections at the factory before shipment; (ii) the customer’s need to engage in timely special site preparation to accommodate such a scanner, over which we have no control or responsibility; (iii) additional fine tuning of such scanners once they are installed; (iv) design or specification changes by the customer; and (v) delays originating from other contractors on the project. 

 

At June 30, 2004, our backlog totaled approximately $84.9 million, compared to approximately $53.0 million at June 30, 2003 and approximately $89.6 million at June 30, 2002. The increase in the backlog from June 30, 2003 to June 30, 2004 is primarily due to the acquisition of Spacelabs Medical in March 2004. Excluding Spacelabs Medical, the backlog as of June 30, 2004 was $63.0 million. We expect to ship most of our backlog as of June 30, 2004, during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005. Sales orders underlying our backlog are firm orders. Any failure by us to meet an agreed-upon schedule could lead to the cancellation of the related order. Moreover, from time to time, we may agree to permit the cancellation of an order on a negotiated basis. Variations in the size of the order, the product mix, and delivery requirements of the customer order may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period. Backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenues for any future period and cannot be considered a meaningful indicator of our performance on an annual or quarterly basis. 

 

Employees 

 

As of June 30, 2004, we employed approximately 2,205 people, of whom 1,070 were employed in manufacturing, 255 were employed in research and development, 250 were employed in finance and administration, 310 were employed in sales and marketing, and 320 were employed in our service organization. Of the total employees, approximately 1,470 were employed in the United States and Canada, 250 were employed in Europe, and 485 were employed in Asia. Twelve employees of our Advanced Microelectronics AS subsidiary in Norway and 11 of our Metorex Security Products, Oy subsidiary employees in Finland are union members and have collective bargaining rights; none of our other employees are unionized. We have never experienced a work stoppage or strike, and management believes that its relations with employees are good.
