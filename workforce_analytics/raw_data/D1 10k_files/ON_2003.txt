Item 1.     Business 

Business Overview 

      We are a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components. We design, manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products. Our power management semiconductor components distribute and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices. Our data management semiconductor components provide high-performance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems. Our standard semiconductor components serve as “building block” components within virtually all electronic devices. 

      We serve a broad base of end-user markets including wireless communications, consumer electronics, automotive and industrial electronics and computing and networking. Applications for our products in these markets include portable electronics, computers, game stations, servers, automotive and industrial automation control systems, routers, switches, storage-area networks and automated test equipment. 

      We have four main product lines: power management and standard analog devices, metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) power devices, high frequency clock and data management devices and standard components. Our extensive portfolio of devices enables us to offer advanced integrated circuits and “building block” components that deliver system level functionality and design solutions. Our product portfolio currently comprises approximately 15,000 products and we shipped approximately 21.1 billion units in 2002. We specialize in micro packages, which offer increased performance characteristics while reducing the critical board space inside today’s ever shrinking electronic devices. We believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products provides our customers with single source purchasing on a cost-effective and timely basis. 

      We have approximately 200 direct customers worldwide, and we also service approximately 300 significant original equipment manufacturers indirectly through our distributor and electronic manufacturing service provider customers. Our direct and indirect customers include: (1) leading original equipment manufacturers in a broad variety of industries, such as Alcatel, DaimlerChrysler, Delphi, Delta Electronics, Intel, Motorola, Nokia, Siemens, Sony and Visteon; (2) electronic manufacturing service providers, such as Flextronics, Sanmina-SCI and Solectron; and (3) global distributors, such as Arrow, Avnet and Future Electronics. 

      We have design operations in Arizona, Rhode Island, China, Hong Kong, the Czech Republic and France, and we operate manufacturing facilities independently and through joint ventures in Arizona, Rhode Island, China, the Czech Republic, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Slovakia. 

      Immediately prior to our August 4, 1999 recapitalization, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Motorola, Inc. We held and continue to hold, through direct and indirect subsidiaries and a joint venture, substantially all of the assets and operations of the Semiconductor Components Group of Motorola’s Semiconductor Products Sector. As a result of the recapitalization, an affiliate of Texas Pacific Group owned approximately 91% and Motorola owned approximately 9% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, as part of the recapitalization, Texas Pacific Group received 1,500 shares and Motorola received 590 shares of the Company’s mandatorily redeemable preferred stock with a liquidation value of $209.0 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends. Motorola also received a $91 million junior subordinated note due 2011 issued by Semiconductor Components Industries, LLC, our primary domestic operating subsidiary. Cash payments to Motorola in connection with the recapitalization were financed through equity investments by affiliates of Texas Pacific Group totaling $337.5 million, borrowings totaling $740.5 million under our $875.0 million senior bank facilities and the issuance of $400.0 million of 12% senior subordinated notes due August 2009. Because Texas Pacific Group’s affiliate did not acquire substantially all of our common stock, the recapitalization did not impact the basis of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes. At the time of the recapitalization, Motorola agreed to provide us with transition and manufacturing services in order to facilitate our transition to a stand-alone company independent of Motorola.

      On April 3, 2000, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Cherry Semiconductor Corporation for $253.2 million in cash (including acquisition related costs), which we financed with cash on hand and borrowings of $220.0 million under our senior bank facilities. Cherry Semiconductor Corporation, which we have renamed Semiconductor Components Industries of Rhode Island, Inc., designs and manufactures analog and mixed signal integrated circuits for the power management and automotive markets. (See Note 6 “Acquisition” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in each case included elsewhere in this report.) 

      On May 3, 2000, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock, selling 34.5 million shares with an issue price of $16 per share. Net proceeds from the initial public offering (after deducting issuance costs) were approximately $514.8 million. The net proceeds were used to redeem all outstanding preferred stock (including accrued dividends), redeem a portion of the senior subordinated notes and prepay a portion of the loans outstanding under the senior bank facilities. (See Note 12 “Common Stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report.) 

      On September 7, 2001, we obtained $100.0 million ($99.2 million, net of issuance costs) through an equity investment by an affiliate of Texas Pacific Group, our principal shareholder. In this transaction, we issued 10,000 shares of mandatorily redeemable cumulative convertible preferred stock. This investment was required because we were not in compliance with certain minimum interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio covenants under our senior bank facilities. (See Note 9 “Long-Term Debt” and Note 11 “Redeemable Preferred Stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in each case included elsewhere in this report). 

      On May 6, 2002 we issued $300.0 million principal amount of second lien senior secured notes due 2008. The second lien senior secured notes were issued at a price of 96.902% of par and will mature on May 15, 2008. The second lien senior secured notes initially accrued interest at a rate of 12% per annum. Commencing February 6, 2003, the second lien senior secured notes began accruing interest at a rate of 13% per annum. This increased rate will remain in effect unless on or prior to August 6, 2003 we have issued common stock or certain convertible preferred stock to financial sponsors generating at least $100.0 million in gross cash proceeds to prepay indebtedness under our senior bank facilities or under any other senior credit facility secured by a first-priority lien and have permanently reduced the related loan commitments equal to the amount prepaid. Interest on the second lien senior secured notes is payable semi annually in cash. The obligations under the second lien senior secured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of the domestic subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation (other than Semiconductor Components Industries, LLC, which is a co-issuer). The second lien senior secured notes and the guarantees thereof are secured on a second-priority basis by the assets that secure our senior bank facilities and they rank equal in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness and senior to our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior subordinated and subordinated indebtedness and effectively junior to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries that have not guaranteed such second lien senior secured notes. In connection with the offering of second lien senior secured notes, we amended our senior bank facilities to, among other things, permit the issuance of the second lien senior secured notes, make certain of the financial ratio maintenance requirements thereunder less restrictive and impose minimum EBITDA and cash requirements. (See Note 9 “Long-Term Debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, in each case included elsewhere in this report.) We used $278.6 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of the second lien senior secured notes to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities. Because the remaining principal amount of loans outstanding under our senior bank facilities was reduced below $750.0 million as a result of this refinancing, the supplemental interest charges thereon (described in Note 9 “Long-Term Debt” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report) were reduced from 3.0% to 1.0%. In connection with this refinancing, we wrote off $6.5 million of debt issuance costs.

      On March 3, 2003, we issued $200.0 million principal amount of first lien senior secured notes due 2010. The first lien senior secured notes were issued at a price of 95.467% of par value, bear interest at a rate of 12% per annum, payable semi-annually in cash, and will mature on March 15, 2010. The obligations under the first lien senior secured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by each of the domestic subsidiaries of ON Semiconductor Corporation (other than Semiconductor Components Industries, LLC, which is a co-issuer). The first lien senior secured notes and the guarantees thereof are secured on a first-priority basis by the assets that secure our senior bank facilities and they rank equal in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness and senior to our and the guarantors’ existing and future senior subordinated and subordinated indebtedness and effectively junior to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries that have not guaranteed such notes. In connection with the offering of the first lien senior secured notes, we further amended our senior bank facilities to, among other things, permit the issuance of the first lien senior secured notes, remove certain of the financial ratio maintenance requirements thereunder, make the minimum EBITDA requirement thereunder less restrictive and make the maximum capital expenditure covenant more restrictive. We used $180.9 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of the first lien senior secured notes to prepay a portion of our senior bank facilities, including $25.0 million of which proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and permanently reduce the commitments thereunder by such amount. In connection with this refinancing, we wrote-off $3.5 million of debt issuance costs. 

      The amendment to our senior bank facilities described in the paragraph above also resulted in the conversion of $62.5 million of the outstanding loans under our revolving credit facility into a new tranche of term loans that matures on the date our revolving credit facility matures. As of March 7, 2003, $8.6 million of our $62.5 million revolving credit facility was available, reflecting outstanding loans of $37.5 million and outstanding letters of credit of $16.4 million. As of January 9, 2003, we amended our primary foreign exchange hedging agreement to provide for termination if at any time the amount available under our revolving credit facility is less than $2.5 million. 

      As a response to the downturn in the semiconductor industry, in the fourth quarter of 2000 and in the fourth quarter of 2002 we initiated worldwide profitability enhancement programs to better align our cost structure with our revenues. The principal elements of these programs are (1) implementing a manufacturing rationalization plan that involved, among other things, plant closures and the efficient reallocation of capacity among other facilities, the relocation or outsourcing of related operations to take advantage of lower cost labor markets and the rationalization of our product portfolio; (2) reducing non-manufacturing personnel and implementing other cost controls, in connection with which we have relocated certain of our order entry, finance, quality assurance and information technology functions to lower cost locations and simplified our overall corporate structure and our regional infrastructure; and (3) improving our liquidity by reducing capital expenditures, managing our working capital actively and reducing our cost structure through various measures, including reducing some employee compensation and spending on information technology and outside consultants. Certain elements of these programs that we commenced in June 2001 were completed in the fourth quarter of 2002, and resulted in $365.0 million of annualized cost savings, based on a comparison of our cost structure during the first quarter of 2001 to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2002. In addition, as a result of additional cost cutting commenced in the fourth quarter of 2002, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2003, we expect to achieve an estimated $80.0 million of cost savings in 2003 and an estimated $125.0 million of cost savings in each year thereafter, in both cases as compared to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2002. As a result of these efforts, we incurred restructuring and other charges of $27.7 million in 2002 and $150.4 million in 2001. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included elsewhere in this report. 

      Effective January 1, 2001, we changed our accounting method for recognizing revenue on sales to distributors. Recognition of revenue and related gross profit on sales to distributors is now deferred until the distributor resells the product. We believe that this change better aligns reported results with, focuses us on, and allows investors to better understand end user demand for the products that we sell through distributors. This revenue recognition policy is commonly used in the semiconductor industry. (See Note 4 “Accounting Changes” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in each case included elsewhere in this report.)

      Original Equipment Manufacturers. Direct sales to original equipment manufacturers accounted for approximately 48% of our total revenues in 2002, approximately 47% in 2001 and approximately 44% in 2000. These customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as Alcatel, Hewlett-Packard,

Intel, Motorola, Nokia, Philips, Siemens and Sony, and in the automotive industry such as DaimlerChrysler, Delphi, TRW and Visteon. We focus on three types of original equipment manufacturers: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and target market customers. Large multi-nationals and selected regional accounts, which are significant in specific markets, are our core original equipment manufacturer customers. The target market customers in the communications, power management and standard analog and the high frequency clock and data management markets are original equipment manufacturers that are on the leading edge of specific technologies and provide direction for technology and new product development. Generally, our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty. 
      Distributors. Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 41% of our total revenues in 2002, approximately 43% in 2001 and approximately 44% in 2000. Our distributors, which include Arrow, Avnet, All American, Eliteron and Future, resell to mid-sized and smaller original equipment manufacturers and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies. Sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slow-moving products. Under certain agreements, distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book or that is more than four years older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. However, since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product, sales returns have minimal impact on our profits. 

      Electronic Manufacturing Service Providers. Direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 11% of our total revenues in 2002, approximately 10% in 2001 and approximately 12% in 2000. Our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are Flextronics, Sanmina-SCI and Solectron. These customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers. Originally, these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards, but they now typically provide design, supply management and manufacturing solutions as well. Many original equipment manufacturers now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies. We are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace. 

Manufacturing Operations 

      We operate our manufacturing facilities either directly or through a joint venture. Four of these are front-end wafer facilities located in Japan, Slovakia and the United States; two are back-end assembly and test facilities located in China and the Philippines; and two are integrated front-end and back-end facilities located in Malaysia and the Czech Republic. In addition to these manufacturing and assembly operations, our Terosil facility in Roznov, Czech Republic, manufactures raw wafers that are used by a number of our facilities. During 2001, we made the decision to shutdown our integrated facility in Guadalajara, Mexico and transfer the front-end and back-end manufacturing to other owned and contracted locations. Accordingly, the Guadalajara, Mexico facility ceased operations in the second quarter of 2002. Also during 2001, the back-end only manufacturing operation that was part of the integrated manufacturing operation at Site-2 in Seremban, Malaysia was shutdown and the related production transferred to our joint venture in Leshan, China. Front-end manufacturing remains unchanged at Site-2 and the existing back-end manufacturing remains unchanged at Site-1, also in Seremban, Malaysia. We also use third-party contract manufacturers. Our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts. In some cases, longer-term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship. 

      The table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or through our joint venture, as well as the products produced at these facilities. The sizes of the locations represent the approximate gross square feet of each site’s building and include, among other things, manufacturing, laboratory, warehousing, office, utility, support and unused areas.

      We entered into an agreement with Motorola to continue to provide manufacturing services to each other for limited periods of time following our recapitalization. We negotiated fixed prices with Motorola for the services covered by these agreements to approximate each party’s cost of providing the services. For 2002, 2001 and 2000, Motorola purchased $1.4 million, $8.2 million and $61.7 million, respectively, of manufacturing services from us with no minimum purchase commitments going forward at this time. These purchases are classified as revenues in our financial statements. We purchased $13.8 million, $86.1 million and $162.3 million of manufacturing services from Motorola in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, fulfilling our minimum commitments to purchase manufacturing services from Motorola during such periods. Pursuant to a new agreement with Motorola, we have committed to purchase approximately $1.0 million of manufacturing services from Motorola in 2003. 

      In the Czech Republic, we operate two majority-owned subsidiaries, Tesla and Terosil. These subsidiaries are publicly traded Czech companies in which we directly own 81.6% and 75.6% equity interests as of December 31, 2002, respectively. Tesla operates an integrated front-end manufacturing and back-end assembly facility while Terosil manufactures raw wafers that are used by a number of our facilities. We purchased 95%, 88% and 77% of the total output of Terosil in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and purchased the entire output of Tesla for all three years. In 2001, we entered into new seven-year agreements with Terosil and Tesla where we provide both subsidiaries with forecasted needs on a quarterly basis with minimum commitments limited to our forecasted demand within thirty days from the start of production. 

      In Leshan, China, we operate a joint venture, Leshan-Phoenix Semiconductor Company Ltd. (“Leshan”), which operates a back-end manufacturing facility. We own a majority of the outstanding equity interests of the Leshan joint venture. The other shareholder is a Chinese state owned enterprise named Leshan Radio Company Ltd. Due to certain rights held by this minority shareholder, we do not exercise control over this entity normally commensurate with majority ownership and therefore, account for it using the equity method.

directors of Leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture. These requests represent a purchase commitment by the respective shareholders of the Leshan joint venture; provided, however, that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity (which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity), in lieu of the commitment. We committed to purchase 85%, 81% and 86% of Leshan’s production capacity in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and are currently committed to purchase 82% of Leshan’s expected production capacity in 2003. In 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, we purchased 76%, 43% and 91% of Leshan’s production. Because we purchased less than our committed amounts in 2002 and 2001, we incurred $1.5 million and $6.4 million in underutilization charges, respectively. 
      We provide forecasted needs to Leshan on a periodic basis, an approximate six-month cycle, which are used to establish pricing over the forecasted period, and, as described above, we are responsible for underutilized capacity cost due to variations from our forecasted needs. As part of our manufacturing agreements with Leshan, we supply them with die used in the production process. Sales of die to Leshan are not recorded as revenue due to the related party nature of the transactions. As of December 31, 2002, we had accounts receivable and accounts payable of $9.6 million and $10.2 million, respectively, related to manufacturing activity with Leshan. 

      The Leshan joint venture is one of our lowest cost providers and we anticipate any future expansion plans will include this facility, including the previously announced start of construction in August 2002 of a 6-inch wafer fabrication facility at Leshan. In June 2002, we obtained approval from the Chinese government for the Leshan joint venture to invest up to $231 million for semiconductor operations, which is in addition to the $278 million originally approved. At December 31, 2002 our total investment in and advances to this joint venture was $99.3 million, including loans of $63.3 million. 

      Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, copper lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. We have no material agreements with any of our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a just-in-time basis. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. 

      We also use third-party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities, primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods. These contract manufacturers, including ASAT, Amkor, PSI, AIT, ASE, Hynix, Liteon, Chartered and Phenitec, accounted for approximately 30%, 31% and 40% of our cost of sales in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These reductions in the use of third-party contractors were part of our efforts to improve internal capacity utilization under our manufacturing rationalization plan. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

      As of December 31, 2002, our global sales and marketing organization consists of approximately 410 professionals operating out of approximately 50 offices and serving customers in 39 countries. We support our customers through logistics organizations and just-in-time warehouses. Global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service. We offer efficient, cost-effective internet-based applications support from our laboratories in the Czech Republic, China and the United States. Through on-line connectivity, applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all other regions. Pursuant to our restructuring programs, we have downsized our sales force by approximately 230 employees, closed approximately 20 of our sales offices and, in some regions, converted sales personnel to sales representatives. In addition, we have centralized and relocated our order entry functions to low cost locations. As a result of additional cost cutting measures announced in the fourth quarter of 2002, we expect further downsizing. (See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 5 “Restructuring and Other Charges” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements, in each case as included elsewhere in this report). 

      Motorola agreed to provide us with worldwide shipping and freight services for a period of up to three years following our 1999 recapitalization. This resulted in better prices than we could obtain from third parties.

Cost increases resulting from the termination of the shipping and freight service agreement in July 2002 were estimated to be approximately $11 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. 
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Other Intellectual Property Rights 

      We market our products under our registered trademark ON Semiconductor® and our ON logo. We own rights to a number of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property directly related to and important to our business. In connection with our recapitalization, Motorola assigned, licensed, or sublicensed, as the case may be, to us certain intellectual property to support and continue the operation of our business. As of February 10, 2003, we had approximately 450 U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 160 patent applications pending worldwide. Our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2003 to 2021. None of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect our business. Additionally, we hold more than 215 U.S. and foreign trademarks and applications. Our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our intellectual property rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. 

      Under an intellectual property agreement that we entered into with Motorola as part of our recapitalization, Motorola assigned approximately 295 U.S. patents and patent applications, approximately 292 foreign patents and patent applications, rights to over 50 trademarks (not including the Motorola name) previously used in connection with our products, rights in know-how relating to at least 39 semiconductor fabrication processes and rights in specified copyrightable materials. In addition, Motorola licensed on a non-exclusive, royalty-free basis other patent, trademark, copyright and know-how rights used in connection with our then existing products and products contemplated in our long-range plans. We have perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide rights under Motorola’s patent portfolio and other intellectual property, existing as of the date of our recapitalization or created in the five years thereafter (the five-year period existing only with respect to patents), as necessary to manufacture, market, and sell our then existing and long range plan product lines. Additionally, Motorola provided us with a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from certain infringement claims by third parties who had granted Motorola licenses as of the date of our recapitalization, which will assist us in developing our own patent position and licensing program. We believe that we have the right to use all Motorola-owned technology used in connection with the products we currently offer. 

Seasonality 

      Historically, our revenues have been affected by the seasonal trends of the semiconductor and related industries. As a result of these trends, we typically experienced sales increases in the first two quarters of the year and relatively flat sales levels in the third and fourth quarters. However, over the past three years, various events have disrupted this pattern. In the fourth quarter of 2000, and throughout 2001, revenues declined due to slowing demand in the semiconductor market and the general economic decline. In 2002, revenues were relatively flat and at this time, it is unclear when the semiconductor industry is going to return to its seasonal trends. 

Backlog 

      Our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders that are booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery. Generally, prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking. Backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and our estimates of orders based on customer forecasts, in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13-week period following such date. Backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand, pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times. During 2002, our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 74% and 87% of actual revenues during such quarter. Our backlog has increased from $199 million as of December 31, 2001 to $211 million as of December 31, 2002. 

      In the semiconductor industry, backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs. Agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or, as a matter of industry practice, are often not enforced. Therefore, a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable. For these reasons, the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results.

      We sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that are typically annual fixed-price agreements subject, in some cases, to quarterly negotiations. These contracts allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with just-in-time principles while shortening the cycle times required to produce ordered product. However, these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations. 

Competition 

      The semiconductor industry, particularly the market for general-purpose semiconductor products like ours, is highly competitive. Although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines, we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies, as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. Because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits, we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits, application-specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits, as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products. (See “Risk Factors — Competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs” elsewhere in this report.) 

      We compete with respect to power management and standard analog products, standard components, MOS power devices and high frequency clock and data management products in the following manner: 

 
  
 Power Management and Standard Analog product line 

      The principal methods of competition in this product line are new product innovation, technical performance, quality, service and price. Our competitive strengths in this product line are our strong technology and design resources, our industry recognition in applications, such as automotive, and our market share in this segment. Our significant competitors in this market include Texas Instruments, ST Microelectronics, Linear Technology, National Semiconductor, and Fairchild Semiconductor. Several of these competitors are larger in scale and size, have substantially greater financial and other resources than us with which to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. Our weak presence in the Japanese market presents a competitive challenge to us as it reduces our revenue stream and market share. 

 
  
 Standard Components product line 

      The principal methods of competition in this product line are price, technical performance, quality and service. Our competitive strengths in this product line are the breadth of our portfolio, our low cost manufacturing capability, our global market presence and our ability to service broad application market segments. The strong acceptance of ON’s MicroIntegrationTM capability (with ability to integrate both active and passive components in multi-chip or monolithic approaches) into various applications in our existing markets is an additional competitive strength in this product line. Our significant competitors in this market include Fairchild Semiconductor, Philips, Rohm, ST Microelectronics, Texas Instruments, and Toshiba. Many of these competitors are larger in scale and size, have substantially greater financial and other resources than us with which to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. Our weak presence in the Japanese market presents a competitive challenge to us as it reduces our revenue stream and market share. Due to the high commodity nature of the standard component market, these products have a higher susceptibility to downward price pressure in market downturns. 

 
  
 MOS Power Devices product line 

      The principal methods of competition in this product line are new product innovation, technical performance, price, quality and service. Our competitive strengths in this product line are our strong presence in areas such as IGBT’s and low voltage planar technology, our broad product offering and our low cost manufacturing capability. Our significant competitors in this market include Fairchild, International Rectifier, and Vishay. Some of these competitors are larger in scale and size, have substantially greater financial and other resources than us with which to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and

distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. Our weak presence in the Japanese market presents a competitive challenge to us as it reduces our revenue stream and market share. 
 
  
 High Frequency Clock and Data Management product line 

      The principal methods of competition in this product line are new product innovation, technical performance, quality, service and price. Our competitive strengths in this product line are our leading market share as the number one supplier and the utilization of our existing products in advance high speed technology, such as Silicon Germanium. Our significant competitors in this market include Micrel, Semtech, and Motorola. Although we have a dominant share in this market, the total potential revenue has been reduced commensurate with the downturn in the networking, telecommunications and automated test equipment market segments, which currently drive the applications for this product. 

Research and Development 

      Company-sponsored research and development costs in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $67.9 million (6.3% of total revenues), $80.9 million (6.7% of total revenues) and $69.2 million (3.3% of total revenues), respectively. The increase between 2000 and 2001 resulted primarily from increased spending on new product development. The primary emphasis of our new product development efforts is on power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management solutions, the highest margin product lines within our portfolio, with 80% of our overall research and development investments currently targeted in these areas. Since our IPO in May 2000, we have introduced over 850 new products, and the portion of our revenue attributable to new products has increased over the last three years. Our target for research and development expenditures is 6% of revenues in 2003. 

Government Regulation 

      Our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water; the management and disposal of hazardous substances; the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites; and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination. 

      Our manufacturing facility in Phoenix, Arizona is located on property that is a “Superfund” site, a property listed on the National Priorities List and subject to clean-up activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Motorola is actively involved in the cleanup of on-site solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and off-site contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the State of Arizona. As part of our recapitalization, Motorola has retained responsibility for this contamination, and has agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter. 

      Manufacturing facilities in Slovakia and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries in the Czech Republic have ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that these facilities were operated by government-owned entities. In each case, these remediation projects consist primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located on-site and off-site with additional action plans developed to respond in the event activity levels are exceeded at each of the respective locations. The governments of the Czech Republic and Slovakia have agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries, subject to specified limitations, for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination. Based upon the information available, we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material. 

      Our manufacturing facility in East Greenwich, Rhode Island has adjoining property that has localized soil contamination. In connection with the purchase of the facility, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Covenant Not To Sue with the State of Rhode Island. This agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property. Based on the information available, we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material.

      We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. We do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, and liability for currently known environmental conditions, to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects. It is possible, however, that future developments, including changes in laws and regulations, government policies, customer specification, personnel and physical property conditions, including currently undiscovered contamination, could lead to material costs. 

Employees 

      As of December 31, 2002, we employed approximately 9,570 worldwide, consisting of approximately 7,820 people employed directly and approximately 1,750 people employed through our joint venture in Leshan, China, most of whom are engaged in manufacturing services. We do not currently have any collective bargaining arrangements with our employees, except for those arrangements, such as works councils, that are obligatory for all employees or all employers in a particular industry under applicable foreign law. Of the total number of our employees (including our joint venture in Leshan, China) as of December 31, 2002, approximately 8,230 were engaged in manufacturing and information services, approximately 410 were engaged in our sales and marketing organization and in customer service, approximately 460 were engaged in administration and approximately 470 were engaged in research and development.
