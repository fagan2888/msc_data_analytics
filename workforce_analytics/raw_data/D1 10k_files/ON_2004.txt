Item 1.    Business 

 

Business Overview 

 

We are a global supplier of power and data management semiconductors and standard semiconductor components. We design, manufacture and market an extensive portfolio of semiconductor components that addresses the design needs of sophisticated electronic systems and products. Our power management semiconductor components distribute and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices. Our data management semiconductor components provide high-performance clock management and data flow management for precision computing and communications systems. Our standard semiconductor components serve as “building block” components within virtually all electronic devices. 

 

We serve a broad base of end-user markets, including computing, automotive electronics, consumer electronics, industrial electronics, wireless communications and networking. Applications for our products in these markets include portable electronics, computers, game stations, servers, automotive and industrial automation control systems, routers, switches, storage-area networks and automated test equipment. 

 

We have four main product lines: power management and standard analog devices, metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) power devices, high frequency clock and data management devices and standard components. Our extensive portfolio of devices enables us to offer advanced integrated circuits and the “building block” components that deliver system level functionality and design solutions. Our product portfolio currently comprises approximately 17,000 products and we shipped approximately 25.4 billion units in 2003. We specialize in micro packages, which offer increased performance characteristics while reducing the critical board space inside today’s ever shrinking electronic devices. We believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products provides our customers with single source purchasing on a cost-effective and timely basis. 

 

We have approximately 200 direct customers worldwide, and we also service approximately 300 significant original equipment manufacturers indirectly through our distributor and electronic manufacturing service provider customers. Our direct and indirect customers include: (1) leading original equipment manufacturers in a broad variety of industries, such as Alcatel, Intel, Motorola, Nokia, Philips, Siemens and Sony; (2) electronic manufacturing service providers, such as Flextronics, Jabil and Solectron; and (3) global distributors, such as Arrow, Avnet, EBV Elektronik, Future, Solomon Enterprise and World Peace. 

 

We currently have design operations in Arizona, Rhode Island, Texas, China, the Czech Republic and France, and we currently operate manufacturing facilities in Arizona, Rhode Island, China, the Czech Republic, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Slovakia. 

 

Immediately prior to our August 4, 1999 recapitalization, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Motorola, Inc. We held and continue to hold, through direct and indirect subsidiaries, substantially all of the assets and operations of the Semiconductor Components Group of Motorola’s Semiconductor Products Sector. As a result of the recapitalization, an affiliate of Texas Pacific Group owned approximately 91% and Motorola owned approximately 9% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, as part of the recapitalization, Texas Pacific Group received 1,500 shares and Motorola received 590 shares of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock with a liquidation value of $209.0 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends. Motorola also received a $91.0 million junior subordinated note due 2011 issued by Semiconductor Components Industries, LLC, our primary domestic operating subsidiary. Cash payments to Motorola in connection with the recapitalization were financed through equity investments by affiliates of Texas Pacific Group totaling $337.5 million, borrowings totaling $740.5 million under our $875.0 million senior bank facilities and the issuance of $400.0 million of 12% senior subordinated notes due August 2009. Because Texas Pacific Group’s affiliate did not acquire substantially all of

Table of Contents
our common stock, the recapitalization did not impact the basis of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes. At the time of the recapitalization, Motorola agreed to provide us with transition and manufacturing services in order to facilitate our transition to a stand-alone company independent of Motorola. 

 

On April 3, 2000, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Cherry Semiconductor Corporation for $253.2 million in cash (including acquisition related costs), which we financed with cash on hand and borrowings of $220.0 million under our senior bank facilities. Cherry Semiconductor Corporation, which we have renamed Semiconductor Components Industries of Rhode Island, Inc., designs and manufactures analog and mixed signal integrated circuits for the power management and automotive markets. 

 

On May 3, 2000, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock, selling 34.5 million shares with an issue price of $16 per share. Net proceeds from the initial public offering (after deducting issuance costs) were approximately $514.8 million. The net proceeds were used to redeem all outstanding preferred stock (including accrued dividends), redeem a portion of the senior subordinated notes and prepay a portion of the loans outstanding under the senior bank facilities. (See Note 11 “Common Stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report.) 

 

On September 7, 2001, we obtained $100.0 million ($99.2 million, net of issuance costs) through an equity investment by an affiliate of Texas Pacific Group, our principal shareholder. In this transaction, we issued 10,000 shares of mandatorily redeemable cumulative convertible preferred stock. This investment was required because we were not in compliance with certain minimum interest expense coverage ratio and leverage ratio covenants under our senior bank facilities. (See Note 7 “Long-Term Debt” and Note 10 “Redeemable Preferred Stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in each case included elsewhere in this report). 

 

Since our 1999 recapitalization, we have had relatively high levels of long-term debt as compared to our principal competitors. We reduced our total debt and interest expense as a result of two recent public offerings of common stock in September 2003 and February 2004, a portion of the proceeds from which we applied to prepay and redeem a portion of our outstanding debt prior to scheduled maturity. During 2002 and 2003, we engaged in several debt refinancing transactions, which extended a portion of our debt maturities. Some of the transactions that extended our debt maturities also resulted in an increase in our overall interest expense and others lowered our overall interest expense. In connection with these transactions, we amended our senior bank facilities to, among other things, make our financial covenants less restrictive on the whole. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 7 “Long-Term Debt” and Note 11 “Common Stock” of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further details on these financing activities. 

 

Since the fourth quarter of 2000, we have been implementing a profitability enhancement program to improve our cost structure and as a result, we expect to rank, as compared to our primary competitors, among the lowest in terms of cost structure. As a result of the elements of this program that we started in June 2001 and completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 (the 2000 plan), we achieved approximately $365 million of annualized cost savings, based on a comparison of our cost structure during the first quarter of 2001 to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2002. As a result of additional cost cutting commenced in the fourth quarter of 2002, which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2003 (the 2002 plan), we believe that we achieved an estimated $114 million of cost savings in 2003, as compared to our cost structure during the third quarter of 2002, and we expect to achieve an estimated $151 million of annual costs savings beginning in 2004 from the 2002 plan. These savings are as a result of our manufacturing rationalization plan, reductions in non-manufacturing personnel and other cost controls. Our manufacturing rationalization plan included movement of our manufacturing operations from high cost regions in North America to lower cost regions in Asia and Central Europe. As a result, approximately 79% of our cost of goods sold in 2003 related to our manufacturing operations outside of North America. More recently, we announced that we intend to phase out our manufacturing operations in East Greenwich, R.I. and our assembly and test operations in the Czech Republic. We estimate these activities will be complete by the end of 2004.

Customers 

 

We have been doing business with 46 of our 50 largest customers for more than five years. Sales agreements with customers are renewable periodically and contain certain terms and conditions with respect to payment, delivery, warranty and supply but do not require minimum purchase commitments. Most of our original equipment manufacturer customers negotiate pricing terms with us on an annual basis near the end of the calendar year while our other customers generally negotiate pricing terms with us on a quarterly basis. Our products are ultimately purchased for use in a variety of end markets: computing, automotive electronics, consumer electronics, industrial electronics, wireless communications and networking. Sales to our largest customers, Arrow, Avnet and Motorola, accounted for approximately 9%, 13% and 7%, respectively, of our total revenue during 2003, as compared to 10%, 10% and 8% during 2002. 

 

We generally warrant that products sold to our customers will, at the time of shipment, be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our approved specifications. Subject to certain exceptions, our standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of (1) three years from the date of shipment or (2) the period of time specified in the customer’s standard warranty (provided that the customer’s standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge). Warranty expense to date has been minimal. Generally, our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty.

Original Equipment Manufacturers.    Direct sales to original equipment manufacturers accounted for approximately 42% of our revenues in 2003, approximately 48% in 2002, and approximately 47% in 2001. These customers include a variety of companies in the electronics industry such as Alcatel, Intel, Motorola, Nokia, Philips, Siemens and Sony, and in the automotive industry such as DaimlerChrysler, Delphi, TRW and Visteon. We focus on three types of original equipment manufacturers: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and target market customers. Large multi-nationals and selected regional accounts, which are significant in specific markets, are our core original equipment manufacturer customers. The target market customers in the communications, power management and standard analog and the high frequency clock and data management markets are original equipment manufacturers that are on the leading edge of specific technologies

and provide direction for technology and new product development. Generally, our original equipment manufacturer customers do not have the right to return our products other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty. 

 

Distributors.    Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 47% of our revenues in 2003, approximately 41% in 2002, and approximately 43% in 2001. Our distributors, which include Arrow, Avnet, EBV Elektronik, Future, Solomon Enterprise and World Peace resell to mid-sized and smaller original equipment manufacturers and to electronic manufacturing service providers and other companies. Sales to distributors are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slow-moving products. Under certain agreements, distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book or that is more than four years older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. However, since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product, sales returns have minimal impact on our profits. 

 

Electronic Manufacturing Service Providers.    Direct sales to electronic manufacturing service providers accounted for approximately 11% of our revenues in 2003, approximately 11% in 2002 and approximately 10% in 2001. Our largest electronic manufacturing service customers are Flextronics, Jabil and Solectron. These customers are manufacturers who typically provide contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers. Originally, these companies were involved primarily in the assembly of printed circuit boards, but they now typically provide design, supply management and manufacturing solutions as well. Many original equipment manufacturers now outsource a large part of their manufacturing to electronic manufacturing service providers in order to focus on their core competencies. We are pursuing a number of strategies to penetrate this increasingly important marketplace. 

 

Manufacturing Operations 

 

We operate our manufacturing facilities either directly or through a joint venture. Five of these are front-end wafer facilities located in Japan, Slovakia, Malaysia and the United States; three are back-end assembly and test facilities located in China, Malaysia and the Philippines; and one is an integrated front-end and back-end facility located in the Czech Republic. In addition to these manufacturing and assembly operations, our facility in Roznov, Czech Republic manufactures raw wafers that are used by a number of our facilities. 

 

During 2001, we decided to shut down our integrated facility in Guadalajara, Mexico and transfer the front-end and back-end manufacturing to other owned and contracted locations. Accordingly, the Guadalajara, Mexico facility ceased operations in the second quarter of 2002 and was sold in the third quarter of 2003. In November 2003, we announced our decision to discontinue our assembly and test operations at our site in Roznov, Czech Republic and move these operations to our facility in Seremban, Malaysia and to contract manufacturers. In December 2003, we announced our decision to phase out manufacturing operations at our facility in East Greenwich, R.I. We estimate this closure will be complete by the end of 2004. We plan to transfer most of the production of this facility to our lower cost manufacturing facilities outside of North America and the balance to lower cost contract manufacturers.

Our operations in the Czech Republic are held through a publicly traded Czech company, of which we owned approximately 90% of the outstanding equity interests as of December 31, 2003. We purchased 100%, 95% and 88% of the raw wafer output in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and purchased the entire output of the integrated facility for all three years. In 2001, we entered into a new seven-year agreement with this subsidiary pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase minimum amounts of product based on our forecasted quarterly requirements. 

 

We operate a back-end manufacturing facility in Leshan, China. We own this facility through a joint venture company, Leshan-Phoenix Semiconductor Company Ltd of which we owned a majority of the outstanding equity interests as of December 31, 2003. Our joint venture partner, Leshan Radio Company Ltd. is a formerly state-owned enterprise. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement, requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of Leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture. Each request represents a purchase commitment by the requesting shareholder, provided that the shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity (which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity) in lieu of satisfying the commitment. We committed to purchase 82%, 85% and 81% of Leshan’s production capacity in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and are currently committed to purchase 86% of Leshan’s expected production capacity in 2004. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, we incurred $0.5 million, $1.5 million and $6.4 million in underutilization charges, respectively. As part of our manufacturing agreements with Leshan, we supply die used in the production process.

Table of Contents
The Leshan facility is one of our lowest cost manufacturing operations, and we anticipate that any future expansion of our manufacturing capacity would involve this facility, including the previously announced start of construction in August 2002 of a 6-inch wafer fabrication facility. In June 2002, we obtained approval from the Chinese government for the Leshan joint venture to invest up to $231 million in semiconductor operations, which is in addition to the $278 million originally approved. We have the ability to pace these expenditures at our discretion to meet market demand and therefore expect these investments to occur gradually over time. 

 

Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, copper lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. We have no material agreements with any of our suppliers that impose minimum or continuing supply obligations and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a just-in-time basis. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Although we believe that supplies of the raw materials we use are currently and will continue to be available, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. 

 

We also use third-party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities, primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods. Our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts. In come cases, longer-term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship. These contract manufacturers, including Amkor, PSI, AIT, ASE, KEC, Hynix, Liteon, Chartered and Phenitec, accounted for approximately 26%, 30% and 31% of our cost of sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The reductions in the use of third-party contractors reflect our efforts to improve internal capacity utilization under our manufacturing rationalization plan. 

 

We entered into an agreement with Motorola to continue to provide manufacturing services to each other for limited periods of time following our 1999 recapitalization. We negotiated fixed prices with Motorola for the services covered by these agreements to approximate each party’s cost of providing the services. For 2003, 2002, and 2001, Motorola purchased $3.4 million, $1.4 million and $8.2 million, respectively, of manufacturing services from us with no minimum purchase commitments going forward at this time. These purchases are classified as revenues in our financial statements. We purchased $8.9 million, $14.3 million and $87.4 million of manufacturing services from Motorola in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, fulfilling our minimum commitments to purchase manufacturing services from Motorola during such periods. We currently have no minimum commitments to purchase manufacturing services from Motorola. 

 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

 

As of December 31, 2003, our global sales and marketing organization consists of approximately 406 professionals operating out of approximately 45 offices and serving customers in 37 countries. We support our customers through logistics organizations and just-in-time warehouses. Global and regional distribution channels further support our customers’ needs for quick response and service. We offer efficient, cost-effective internet-based applications support from our laboratories in the Czech Republic, China and the United States. Through on-line connectivity, applications developed in one region of the world are now instantaneously available to all other regions. Pursuant to our restructuring programs, we have downsized our sales force by approximately 230 employees, closed approximately 20 of our sales offices and, in some regions, converted sales personnel to sales representatives. In addition, we have centralized and relocated our order entry functions to low cost locations. Motorola agreed to provide us with worldwide shipping and freight services for a period of up to three years following our 1999 recapitalization. This resulted in better prices than we could obtain from third parties. Cost increases resulting from the termination of the shipping and freight service agreement in July 2002 were estimated to be approximately $11 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. We have negotiated improved freight agreements and changed some logistic flows to offset some of the increase in our 2003 total freight costs.

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Other Intellectual Property Rights 

 

We market our products under our registered trademark ON Semiconductor® and our ON logo. We own rights to a number of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property directly related to and important to our business. In connection with our 1999 recapitalization, Motorola assigned, licensed, or sublicensed, as the case may be, to us certain intellectual property to support and continue the operation of our business. As of January 16, 2004, we had approximately 474 U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 187 patent applications pending worldwide. Our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2004 to 2022. None of our patents that expire in the near future materially affect our business. Additionally, we hold more than 230 U.S. and foreign trademarks and applications. Our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our intellectual property rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents, copyrights and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. 

 

Under an intellectual property agreement that we entered into with Motorola as part of our 1999 recapitalization, Motorola assigned approximately 295 U.S. patents and patent applications, approximately 292 foreign patents and patent applications, rights to over 50 trademarks (not including the Motorola name) previously used in connection with our products, rights in know-how relating to at least 39 semiconductor fabrication processes and rights in specified copyrightable materials. In addition, Motorola licensed on a non-exclusive, royalty-free basis other patent, trademark, copyright and know-how rights used in connection with our then existing products and products contemplated in our long-range plans. We have perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide rights under Motorola’s patent portfolio and other intellectual property, existing as of the date of our recapitalization or created in the five years thereafter (the five-year period existing only with respect to patents), as necessary to manufacture, market, and sell our then existing and long range plan product lines. Additionally, Motorola provided us with a limited indemnity umbrella to protect us from certain infringement claims by third parties who had granted Motorola licenses as of the date of our recapitalization, which will assist us in developing our own patent position and licensing program. We believe that we have the right to use all Motorola-owned technology used in connection with the products we currently offer. 

 

Seasonality 

 

Historically, our revenues have been affected by the seasonal trends of the semiconductor and related industries. As a result of these trends, we typically experienced sales increases in the first two quarters of the year and relatively flat sales levels in the third and fourth quarters. However, over the past three years, various events have disrupted this pattern. Throughout 2001, revenues declined due to slowing demand in the semiconductor market and the general economic decline. In 2002 and 2003, revenues fluctuated within a narrow range and at this time, it is unclear when the semiconductor industry is going to return to its seasonal trends. 

 

Backlog 

 

Our trade sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders that are booked as far as 26 weeks in advance of delivery. Generally, prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking. Backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demands from our Electronic Data Interface customers, in each case scheduled to be shipped over the 13-week period following such date. Backlog is influenced by several factors including market demand, pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times. Because we record revenues on a “sell-through” basis, backlog comprised of orders from distributors will not result in revenues until the distributors sell the products ordered. During 2003, our backlog at the beginning of each quarter represented between 76% and 81% of actual revenues during such quarter. As manufacturing capacity utilization in the industry increases, customers tend to order products further in advance and, as a result, backlog at the beginning of a period as a percentage of revenues during such period is likely to increase. 

 

In the semiconductor industry, backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs. Agreements calling for the sale of specific quantities are either contractually subject to quantity revisions or, as a matter of industry practice, are often not enforced.

Therefore, a significant portion of our order backlog may be cancelable. For these reasons, the amount of backlog as of any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of future results. 

 

We sell products to key customers pursuant to contracts that allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow the customers to manage their inventory levels consistent with just-in-time principles while shortening the cycle times required to produce ordered product. However, these contracts are typically amended to reflect changes in customer demands and periodic price renegotiations. 

 

Competition 

 

The semiconductor industry, particularly the market for general-purpose semiconductor products like ours, is highly competitive. Although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines, we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies, as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. Because our components are often building block semiconductors that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits, we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits, application-specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits, as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products. (See “Risk Factors — Competition in our industry could prevent us from maintaining our revenues and from raising prices to offset increases in costs” elsewhere in this report.) 

 

We compete with respect to power management and standard analog products, standard components, MOS power devices and high frequency clock and data management products in the following manner: 

 

Power Management and Standard Analog product line 

 

The principal methods of competition in this product line are new product innovation, technical performance, quality, service and price. Our competitive strengths in this product line are our strong technology and design resources, our industry recognition in applications, such as automotive, and our market share in this segment. Our significant competitors in this market include Fairchild, Linear Technology, National Semiconductor, New Japan Radio, ST Microelectronics, and Texas Instruments. Several of these competitors are larger in scale and size, have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. A competitive challenge in this product line is our small market share with certain Japanese customers that tend to favor local suppliers for their new product designs. If we are not identified as a vendor in the product design phase, in most cases it is difficult to convince the manufacturer of the product to substitute our components during the production phase. 

 

Standard Components product line 

 

The principal methods of competition in this product line are price, technical performance, quality and service. Our competitive strengths in this product line are the breadth of our portfolio, our low cost manufacturing capability, our global market presence and our ability to service broad application market segments. The strong acceptance of ON’s MicroIntegration™ capability (with ability to integrate both active and passive components in multi-chip or monolithic approaches) into various applications in our existing markets is an additional competitive strength in this product line. Our significant competitors in this market include Fairchild Semiconductor, Philips, Renesas, Rohm, ST Microelectronics, Texas Instruments, and Toshiba. Several of these competitors are larger in scale and size, have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. A competitive challenge in this product line is our small market share with certain Japanese customers that tend to favor local suppliers for their new product designs. If we are not identified as a vendor in the product design phase, in most cases it is difficult to convince the manufacturer of the product to substitute our components during the production phase.

MOS Power Devices product line 

 

The principal methods of competition in this product line are new product innovation, technical performance, price, quality and service. Our competitive strengths in this product line are our strong presence in areas such as IGBT’s and low voltage planar technology, our broad product offering, and our state-of-the-art trench technology. Our significant competitors in this market include Fairchild, Infineon, International Rectifier, Renesas, ST Microelectronics and Vishay. Several of these competitors are larger in scale and size, have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products and are better able to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. A competitive challenge in this product line is our small market share with certain Japanese customers that tend to favor local suppliers for their new product designs. If we are not identified as a vendor in the product design phase, in most cases it is difficult to convince the manufacturer of the product to substitute our components during the production phase. 

 

High Frequency Clock and Data Management product line 

 

The principal methods of competition in this product line are new product innovation, technical performance, quality, service and price. Our competitive strengths in this product line are our use of specialized high speed materials like silicon germanium and the volume benefits which come from being one of the largest suppliers in this segment. Our significant competitors in this market include Fairchild, Maxim, Micrel, Motorola and Semtech. Although we have a significant share in this market, the total potential revenue has been reduced commensurate with the downturn in the networking, telecommunications and automated test equipment market segments, which currently drive the applications for this product. 

 

Research and Development 

 

Company-sponsored research and development costs in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $85.5 million (8.0% of revenues), $81.5 million (7.5% of revenues) and $94.5 million (7.7% of revenues), respectively. The primary emphasis of our new product development efforts is on power management and standard analog and high frequency clock and data management solutions, the highest margin product lines within our portfolio, with over 70% of our overall research and development investments currently targeted in these areas. Since our IPO in May 2000, we have introduced over 1,000 new products, and the portion of our revenue attributable to new products has increased over the last three years. 

 

Government Regulation 

 

Our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water; the management and disposal of hazardous substances; the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites; and the investigation and remediation of resulting contamination. 

 

Our manufacturing facility in Phoenix, Arizona is located on property that is a “Superfund” site, a property listed on the National Priorities List and subject to clean-up activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Motorola is actively involved in the cleanup of on-site solvent contaminated soil and groundwater and off-site contaminated groundwater pursuant to consent decrees with the State of Arizona. As part of our 1999 recapitalization, Motorola has retained responsibility for this contamination, and has agreed to indemnify us with respect to remediation costs and other costs or liabilities related to this matter. 

 

Manufacturing facilities in Slovakia and those of our majority-owned subsidiary in the Czech Republic have ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous substances that occurred during the years that these facilities were operated by government-owned entities. In each case, these remediation projects consist primarily of monitoring groundwater wells located on-site and off-site with additional action plans developed to

respond in the event activity levels are exceeded at each of the respective locations. The governments of the Czech Republic and Slovakia have agreed to indemnify us and the respective subsidiaries, subject to specified limitations, for remediation costs associated with this historical contamination. Based upon the information available, we do not believe that total future remediation costs to us will be material. 

 

Our manufacturing facility in East Greenwich, Rhode Island has adjoining property that has localized soil contamination. In connection with the purchase of the facility, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Covenant Not To Sue with the State of Rhode Island. This agreement requires that remedial actions be undertaken and a quarterly groundwater monitoring program be initiated by the former owners of the property. Based on the information available, we do not believe that any costs to us in connection with this matter will be material. 

 

We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. We do not expect the cost of compliance with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, and liability for currently known environmental conditions, to have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects. It is possible, however, that future developments, including changes in laws and regulations, government policies, customer specification, personnel and physical property conditions, including currently undiscovered contamination, could lead to material costs. 

 

Employees 

 

As of December 31, 2003, we employed approximately 10,055 worldwide. We do not currently have any collective bargaining arrangements with our employees, except for those arrangements, such as works councils, that are obligatory for all employees or all employers in a particular industry under applicable foreign law. Of the total number of our employees as of December 31, 2003, approximately 8,857 were engaged in manufacturing and information services, approximately 406 were engaged in our sales and marketing organization and in customer service, approximately 325 were engaged in administration and approximately 467 were engaged in research and development.
