Item 1.     Business 

      Except as otherwise indicated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “our,” the “company,” “Fairchild” and “Fairchild International” refer to Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, our principal operating subsidiary. We refer to individual corporations where appropriate. 

      The company’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December. The company’s results for the years ended December 29, 2002, December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000 consist of 52 weeks, 52 weeks, and 53 weeks, respectively. 

General 

      We are one of the largest independent semiconductor companies focused solely on developing, manufacturing and selling high performance semiconductors critical to multiple end markets. We are a global company that designs, develops and markets analog, interface, discrete, standard logic, non-volatile memory and optoelectronic semiconductors. Within our broad product portfolio, we focus on providing power discrete and analog products for power management applications and interface products for system and circuit board interconnect applications. Over two-thirds of our trade sales in 2002 were from power discrete and analog products used directly in power applications such as voltage conversion, power regulation, power distribution, and power and battery management. We believe that we are the world’s leading supplier of combined power analog and power discrete products. Our products are used as building block components in a wide variety of electronic applications, including sophisticated computers and internet hardware; communications; networking and storage equipment; industrial power supply and instrumentation equipment; portable digital consumer cameras, displays, audio/ video devices, household appliances; and automotive ignition applications. Because of their basic functionality, our products provide customers with greater design flexibility than more highly integrated products and help to improve the performance of more complex devices or systems. Given these characteristics, our products have a wide range of applications. Our products are sold to customers in the personal computer, industrial, communications, consumer electronics and automotive markets. 

      With a history dating back more than 40 years, the original Fairchild was one of the founders of the semiconductor industry. Established in 1959 as a provider of memory and logic semiconductors, the Fairchild Semiconductor business was acquired by Schlumberger Limited in 1979 and by National Semiconductor Corporation in 1987. In March 1997, as part of its recapitalization, much of the Fairchild Semiconductor business was sold to a new, independent company — Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation. 

Products and Technology 

      Our products are used in consumer, communications, computer, industrial and automotive applications. Our products are organized into the following three principal product groups that are reportable segments: (1) Analog and Mixed Signal Products (which we sometimes refer to as “Analog”), (2) Discrete Products (which we sometimes refer to as “Discrete”) and (3) Logic and Memory Products (which we sometimes refer to as “Logic and Memory”). Our optoelectronics business does not meet the requirements of a reportable segment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information (“SFAS No. 131”), and is included in the “other” products category. 

     Analog and Mixed Signal Products 

      We design, manufacture and market high-performance analog and mixed signal integrated circuits for computing, consumer, communications, industrial and automotive applications. These products are manufactured using leading-edge Bipolar, CMOS, BiCMOS and BCDMOS technologies. Analog and mixed signal products represent a significant long-term growth area of the semiconductor industry.

Table of Contents

      We offer over 2,800 different analog and mixed signal device products in a fast growing number of proprietary part types. The development of proprietary parts is largely driven by evolving end-system requirements and needs for higher integration, which in turn are driven by trends toward smaller components having higher performance levels. Major competitors include Analog Devices, Linear Technology, Maxim, Intersil Corporation, National Semiconductor, ST Microelectronics, ON Semiconductor and Texas Instruments. 

      Analog products monitor, interpret and control continuously variable functions such as light, color, sound and energy. Frequently, they form the interface with the digital world. We provide a wide range of analog products that perform such tasks as power conversion, interface, temperature sensing, system management, battery charging and motor control. Our power switch products, also called FPS for Fairchild Power Switch, are a series of proprietary, multi-chip or monolithic devices with integrated MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors), which provide complete off-line (AC-DC) power converter designs for use in power supplies and battery chargers. Analog voltage regulator circuits are used to provide constant voltages as well as to step up or step down voltage levels on a circuit board. These products are used in a variety of computing, communications, industrial and consumer applications. 

      Interface products generally connect signals from one part of a system to another part of a system. Typical interface applications include backplane driving, bus driving, clock driving and ‘box-to-box’ or system-to-system interconnects. These applications all require high speed, high current drive and low noise attributes. These types of products are mixed signal in nature and require a high level of analog wave shaping techniques on the output structures. We believe we have developed some unique competencies and patented circuit techniques along with a broad range of process technologies, which we expect to facilitate our expansion into the interface market. 

      The interface market is divided into two categories: “building block interface” and “standards-specific interface products.” Current building block products include our FST, GTL and Low Voltage Differential Swing (LVDS) input/ output (I/O) products. Standards-specific products are normally based on industry standards, which are developed by consortiums of hardware suppliers, software suppliers, end segment customers and industry experts. We are an active participant on many committees where industry standards are developed, and have product offerings in printer interface, dual inline memory module drivers and Universal Serial Bus applications. We have recently entered the Switch Fabric Interface (SFI) I/ O market with physical layer products targeted at server and switch backplane interface applications. 

      In addition to power analog and interface circuits, we offer signal path products like operational amplifiers and comparators, data conversion products, video encoders/decoders, video filters and micro-controller based system management integrated circuits. 

      We believe our analog and mixed signal product portfolio is further enhanced by a broad offering of packaging solutions that we have developed. These solutions include surface mount, tiny packages and leadless carriers. 

     Discrete Products 

      We design, manufacture and market power and small signal discrete semiconductors for computing, automotive, communications, industrial and automotive applications. Discrete devices are individual diodes or transistors that perform power switching, power conditioning and signal amplification functions in electronic circuits. More than 85% of Fairchild’s discrete products are power discretes, which handle greater than one watt of power and are used extensively in power applications. Driving the long-term growth of discretes is the increasing need to power the latest electronic equipment as well as needs to conserve power. We manufacture discrete products using DMOS and Bipolar technologies. Major competitors include International Rectifier, Philips, Infineon, ON Semiconductor and Siliconix/ Vishay. 

      Power MOSFETs. Power MOSFETs are used in applications to switch, shape or transfer electricity under varying power requirements. We are the world’s No. 2 supplier of discrete power MOSFETs, according to the Gartner Group. These products are used in a variety of high-growth applications including computers,

Table of Contents

communications, automotive and industrial supplies, which require low-voltage solutions. We produce advanced MOSFETs under our PowerTrench®, UltraFET® and QFET™ brands. MOSFETs enable computers, automobiles, handsets, power supplies and other products to operate under harsh conditions while providing efficient operation. 
      Isolated-Gate Bipolar Transistors. IGBTs are high-voltage power discrete devices. They are used in switching applications for motor control, power supplies, and automotive ignition systems. We are a leading supplier of IGBTs. We feature the SMPS IGBT for power supplies offering fast, cost-effective operation. We also manufacture modules for home appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators — an application that is growing with the worldwide need to conserve power. 

      Rectifiers. Rectifier products work with IGBTs and MOSFETs in many applications to provide signal conditioning. Our premier product is the Stealth™ rectifier, providing industry leading performance and efficiencies in power supply and motor applications. 

     Logic and Memory Products 

      We design, develop, manufacture and market high-performance standard logic devices utilizing three wafer fabrication processes: CMOS, BiCMOS and Bipolar. Within each of these production processes, we manufacture products that possess advanced performance characteristics, as well as mature products that provide high performance at low cost to customers. Logic products perform a variety of functions in a system mostly in the interface between larger application-specific integrated circuits, microprocessors, memory components or connectors. Products are typically categorized into mature segments and advanced logic segments. Mature products are generally more than five years old, while advanced products tend to be newer. Since market adoption rates of new standard logic families have historically spanned several years, we continue to generate significant revenues from our mature products. Customers are typically slow to move from an older product to a newer one. Further, for any given product, standard logic customers use several different generations of logic products in their designs. As a result, typical life cycles for logic families are often between 20 and 25 years. 

      Investments in mature products tend to focus on cost reductions and manufacturing improvements. Our investments in new products are in the advanced logic area and focuses on power minimization, low voltage and packaging innovations. Some of the targeted products are TinyLogic® and low voltage products. Many of these investments have established our logic devices as key components for the personal computer and portable markets, including cell phones, PDAs and similar battery-based products. Major competitors include Texas Instruments, Toshiba and Philips. 

      We design, manufacture and market non-volatile memory integrated circuits, which are storage devices that retain data after power to the device has been shut off. We offer an extensive portfolio of high performance serial EEPROMs, which are electrically erasable programmable read-only memories. These non-volatile memory devices are used in computing, communications, consumer, automotive and industrial applications. EEPROMs are used primarily to store changing information in consumer products and automotive applications such as cellular handsets, microwave ovens, televisions and automotive controls. Major competitors include ST Microelectronics, Advanced Micro Devices, Atmel and Microchip Technology. 

     Other Products 

          Optoelectronic Products 

      Optoelectronics covers a wide range of semiconductor devices that emit, sense and display both visible and infrared light. Of the six segments of the optoelectronics market, we participate in four: optocouplers, infrared devices, LED lamps and displays. Our focus in optoelectronics is aligned with our analog business. We address the same applications and can combine functions in an optimal way to provide real system solutions. 

      Optocouplers. Optocouplers incorporate infrared emitter and detector combinations in a single package. These products are used to transmit signals between two electronic circuits while maintaining electrical

isolation between them. Major applications for these devices include power supplies, modems, motor controls and power modules. 
      Infrared Products. These devices emit and detect infrared energy instead of visible energy. This product line offers a wide variety of products including plastic emitters and detectors, metal can emitters and detectors, slotted switches and reflective switches. In addition, custom products address specific types of customer applications. Typical applications for infrared products include object detection (for example, paper sensing in printers and copiers and garage door safety sensors), data transmission (for example, remote controls in televisions, stereos, VCRs and wireless data links between computers and other electronic devices) and motor control. 

      LED Lamps and Displays. These devices are replacing general illumination applications currently served by incandescent and fluorescent lighting products. The main advantages are power savings and longer life. This product line includes stick and frame displays, which are used in a broad range of consumer electronics products as well as T-1 and T-1  3/4 lamps that are used in consumer applications and in the industrial, instrument and signage industries. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

      For the year ended December 29, 2002, we derived approximately 60.8%, 34.0% and 5.2% of our net trade sales from distributors, original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing services customers, respectively, through our regional sales organizations. We operate regional sales organizations in Europe, with offices in Wootton-Bassett, England; the Americas, with offices in Chicago; the Asia/ Pacific region, with offices in Hong Kong; the Japan region, with offices in Tokyo; and the Korea region, with offices in Bucheon, South Korea. A discussion of revenue by geographic region for each of the last three years can be found in Item 8, Note 15 of this report. Each of the regional sales organizations is supported by logistics organizations, which manage independently operated free-on-board warehouses. Product orders flow to our manufacturing facilities, where products are made. Products are then shipped either directly to customers or indirectly to customers through independently operated warehouses in Hong Kong, the United States and the United Kingdom. 

      We have dedicated direct sales organizations operating in Europe, the Americas, the Asia/ Pacific region, Japan and Korea that serve our major original equipment manufacturer and electronic manufacturing services customers. We also have a large network of distributors and independent manufacturer’s representatives to distribute and sell our products around the world. We believe that maintaining a small, highly focused, direct sales force selling products for each of our businesses, combined with an extensive network of distributors and manufacturer’s representatives, is the most efficient way to serve our multi-market customer base. Fairchild also maintains a dedicated marketing organization, which consists of marketing organizations in each product group, including tactical and strategic marketing and applications, as well as marketing personnel located in each of the sales regions. 

      Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products, including products that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Some of our sales to distributors, primarily in North America, are made under agreements allowing for market price fluctuations and the right of return on unsold merchandise, subject to time and volume limitations. The majority of these distribution agreements contain a standard stock rotation provision allowing for minimum levels of inventory returns. In our experience, these inventory returns can usually be resold, although often at a discount. Manufacturer’s representatives generally do not offer products that compete directly with our products, but may carry complementary items manufactured by others. Manufacturer’s representatives, who are compensated on a commission basis, do not maintain a product inventory; instead, their customers place large quantity orders directly with us and are referred to distributors for smaller orders. 

Research and Development 

      Our expenditures for research and development (“R&D”) for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $82.2 million, $83.0 million and $83.9 million, respectively. These expenditures represented 6.0%, 6.2% and 5.0% of trade

sales for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Manufacturing technology is a key determinant in the improvement of semiconductor products. Each new generation of process technology has resulted in products with higher speed and greater performance, produced at lower cost. We expect infrastructure investments made in recent years to enable us to continue to achieve high volume, high reliability and low-cost production using leading edge process technology. Our R&D efforts are focused in part on new and innovative packaging solutions that make use of new assembly methods and new high performance packaging materials, which enhance the overall performance and value of both our new and existing products for our customers. We are also using our R&D resources to apply new materials to some of our existing high-performance packages in an effort to reduce manufacturing costs and simplify manufacturing flows, including the use of Lead-free and Halogen-free materials. 
      Each of our product groups maintains independent product research and development organizations, which work closely with our corporate-level process, package and modeling simulation development groups. These groups are located across the globe in our factories and research centers. We work closely with our major customers in many research and development situations in order to increase the likelihood that our products will be designed directly into customers’ products and achieve rapid and lasting market acceptance. 

Manufacturing 

      We operate 11 manufacturing facilities, five of which are front-end wafer fabrication plants in the United States, South Korea and Singapore, and six of which are back-end assembly and test facilities in the United States and Asia. A discussion of property, plant and equipment by geographic region for each of the last three years can be found in Item 8, Note 15 of this report. In June of 2002, we began construction of an assembly and test facility in Suzhou, China. This facility is scheduled to begin production during the second quarter of 2003. In January of 2003, we announced the closing of our 6-inch Fab in Mountaintop, Pennsylvania. All closure activity is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2003. 

      Our products are manufactured and designed using a broad range of manufacturing processes and proprietary design methods. We use all of the prevalent function-oriented process technologies for wafer fabrication, including CMOS, Bipolar, BiCMOS, DMOS and non-volatile memory technologies. We use primarily through-hole and mature and advanced surface mount technologies in our assembly and test operations, in lead counts from 2 to 792 leads.

      We subcontract a minority of our wafer fabrication needs, primarily to Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, Chartered Semiconductor, Torex Semiconductor, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Central Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, UMC, Maxim, and New Japan Radio Corporation. In order to maximize our production capacity, some of our back-end assembly and testing operations are also subcontracted. Primary back-end subcontractors include Amkor, AUK, Enoch, Wooseok, SPS, NS Electronics (Bangkok) Ltd., Samsung Electronics and ChipPAC. The power device business also subcontracts some other manufacturing services from Samsung Electronics. 

      Our manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, copper lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. We obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a just-in-time basis. Although supplies for the raw materials used by us are currently adequate, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. 

Backlog 

      Backlog at December 29, 2002 was approximately $314 million, up from approximately $310 million at December 30, 2001. We define backlog as firm orders or customer-provided forecasts with a customer requested delivery date within 26 weeks. In periods of depressed demand, customers tend to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers, including us. In periods of increased demand, there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and, in some instances, we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, we allow orders to be canceled or deliveries delayed by customers without penalty. Accordingly, our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of future revenues. 

Seasonality 

      Generally, we are affected by the seasonal trends of the semiconductor and related electronics industries. Typically, revenues are higher in the second and fourth quarters, lower in the first quarter due to holidays around the world, and lower in the third quarter due to the historically slow summer months. Throughout most of 2000, however, typical seasonality was offset by the effects of the recovery of the overall semiconductor market, as we recorded sequential revenue increases in each quarter. At the end of 2000 and continuing throughout 2002, we saw atypical quarterly revenue trends as a result of the weakened economic conditions within the semiconductor industry and technology sector. 

Competition 

      Markets for our products are highly competitive. Although only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines, we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major international semiconductor companies. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial and other 

7 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Table of Contents

resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. Competitors include manufacturers of standard semiconductors, application-specific integrated circuits and fully customized integrated circuits, as well as customers who develop their own integrated circuit products. 
      We compete in different product lines to various degrees on the basis of price, technical performance, product features, product system compatibility, customized design, availability, quality and sales and technical support. Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including successful and timely development of new products and manufacturing processes, product performance and quality, manufacturing yields and product availability, capacity availability, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends. 

Trademarks and Patents 

      Our corporate policy is to protect proprietary products by obtaining patents for such products when practicable. Under a technology licensing and transfer agreement with National Semiconductor, entered into in connection with the recapitalization of the Fairchild Semiconductor business in 1997, we acquired approximately 150 U.S. patents and obtained perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive licenses on approximately 250 of National Semiconductor’s patents. We acquired over 60 patents as part of our acquisition of the Raytheon semiconductor business, as well as licensing rights (similar to those granted to Fairchild by National Semiconductor), for other semiconductor-related intellectual property of Raytheon not directly related to its semiconductor business. Similarly, in our acquisition of the power device business, we acquired from Samsung Electronics a significant number of licenses and patents, including approximately 76 U.S. patents and over 1,000 Korean patents. We also received all relevant trademarks. From the acquisitions of QT Optoelectronics, Inc. (“QTO”), KOTA Microcircuits, Inc. (“KOTA”) and Micro Linear and I-Cube, Inc. (“I-Cube”), we added in excess of 80 U.S. and five foreign patents and patent applications to our intellectual property portfolio. From the acquisition of the discrete power products (“DPP”) business from Intersil, we obtained over 500 patents or patent applications worldwide. 

      We believe that we have the right to use all technology used in the production of our products. 

Environmental Matters 

      Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate that regulate, among other things, air and water emissions and discharges at or from our manufacturing facilities; the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials by our company; the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination; and the release of hazardous materials into the environment at or from properties operated by our company and at other sites. As with other companies engaged in like businesses, the nature of our operations exposes our company to the risk of liabilities and claims, regardless of fault, with respect to such matters, including personal injury claims and civil and criminal fines. 

      Our facilities in South Portland, Maine, and, to a lesser extent, West Jordan, Utah, have ongoing remediation projects to respond to releases of hazardous materials that occurred prior to our separation from National Semiconductor. National Semiconductor has agreed to indemnify Fairchild for the cost of these projects, subject to limitations. Based on the historical costs of these projects, we do not believe that future remediation costs will be material, even without the indemnification from National Semiconductor. 

      Our facility in Mountaintop, Pennsylvania has an ongoing remediation project to respond to releases of hazardous materials that occurred prior to our acquisition of the DPP business. Intersil has agreed to indemnify us for specific environmental issues. 

      A property we previously owned in Mountain View, California is listed on the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. We acquired that property as part of the acquisition of the Raytheon semiconductor business. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement with Raytheon, Raytheon retained responsibility for, and has agreed to indemnify us with respect to, remediation costs or other liabilities related to pre-acquisition contamination. The purchaser of the

Mountain View, California property received an environmental indemnity from us similar in scope to the one we received from Raytheon. 
      Although we believe that the power device business has no significant environmental liabilities, Samsung Electronics agreed to indemnify Fairchild for environmental liabilities arising out of the power device business, including the Bucheon, South Korean plant, subject to limitations. 

      We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our costs to comply with environmental regulations were immaterial for 2002, 2001 and 2000. Future laws or regulations and changes in existing environmental laws or regulations, however, may subject our operations to different, additional or more stringent standards. While historically the cost of compliance with environmental laws has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business or financial condition, we cannot predict with certainty our future costs of compliance because of changing standards and requirements. 

Employees 

      Our worldwide workforce consisted of 9,722 full and part-time employees as of December 29, 2002. Of the total number of employees, 8,161 were engaged in manufacturing, 553 were engaged in marketing and sales, 674 were engaged in corporate and product line administration and 334 were engaged in research and development. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. 

      At December 29, 2002, 279 of our employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. These employees are members of the Communication Workers of America/ International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried Machine and Furniture Workers, AFL-CIO, Local 88177. The current agreement with the union ends May 31, 2007 and provides for guaranteed wage and benefit levels as well as employment security for union members. A strike or work stoppage could impact our ability to operate if we were unable to negotiate a new agreement with our represented employees when the existing agreement expires. Also, our profitability could be adversely affected if increased costs associated with any future contracts are not recoverable through productivity improvements or price increases. We believe that relations with our unionized employees are satisfactory. 

      Our wholly owned Korean subsidiary, which we refer to as Fairchild Korea, sponsors a Power Device Business Labor Council consisting of seven representatives from the non-management workforce and seven members of the management workforce. The Labor Council, under Korean law, is recognized as a representative of the workforce for the purposes of consultation and cooperation. The Labor Council has no right to take a work action or to strike and is not party to any labor or collective bargaining agreements with Fairchild Korea. We believe that relations with Fairchild Korea employees and the Labor Council are satisfactory.

Business Risks 

      Our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations: 

      Downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end user market demands could reduce the value of our business. 

      The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and the value of our business may decline during the “down” portion of these cycles. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2000 and continuing through most of 2001, we and the rest of the semiconductor industry experienced backlog cancellations and reduced demand for our products, resulting in significant revenue declines, due to excess inventories at computer and telecommunications equipment manufacturers and general economic conditions, especially in the technology sector. Although we believe the trough of this most recent cycle occurred in the third quarter of 2001, the semiconductor industry has yet to begin a significant recovery. We may experience renewed, possibly more severe and prolonged, downturns in the future as a result of such cyclical changes. Even as demand increases following such downturns, our profitability may not increase because of price competition that historically accompanies recoveries in demand. For example, in 2002, we sold approximately 7% more units than in 2001, yet our revenues were essentially unchanged. In addition, we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales, changes in product mix, changes in end user markets and the costs associated with the introduction of new products. The markets for our products depend on continued demand for personal computers, cellular telephones and consumer electronics and automotive and industrial goods, and these end user markets may experience changes in demand that will adversely affect our prospects. 

      We may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in consumer demands. 

      Our failure to develop new technologies, or react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay development of new products, which could result in decreased revenues and a loss of market share to our competitors. Rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, along with frequent new product introductions, characterize the semiconductor industry. Our financial performance depends on our ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. We may not successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. Products or technologies developed by other companies may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Many of our competitors are larger, older and well established international companies with greater engineering and research and development resources than us. A fundamental shift in technologies in our product markets that we fail to identify or capitalize on relative to our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within our industry. 

      Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our future performance and growth. 

      Failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or having to pay other companies for infringing on or using their intellectual property rights. We rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect such technologies. Some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application, and we cannot assure you that: 

   
  •  the patents owned by us or numerous other patents which third parties license to us will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or licensed to other companies;  
  
  •  any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all.  


      In addition, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in some countries.

      We also seek to protect our proprietary technologies, including technologies that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that such persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of such research. Some of our technologies have been licensed on a non-exclusive basis from National Semiconductor, Samsung Electronics and other companies which may license such technologies to others, including our competitors. In addition, under a technology licensing and transfer agreement, National Semiconductor has limited royalty-free, worldwide license rights (without right to sublicense) to some of our technologies. If necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses under patents or intellectual property rights claimed by others. However, we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us. The failure to obtain a license from a third party for technologies we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the technologies. 

      Our failure to obtain or maintain the right to use some technologies may negatively affect our financial results. 

      Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain or maintain proprietary technologies used in our principal products, which is achieved in part by defending claims by competitors and others of intellectual property infringement. The semiconductor industry is characterized by claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. These claims relate both to products and manufacturing processes. Even though we maintain procedures to avoid infringing others’ rights as part of our product and process development efforts, we cannot assure you that we will be successful, or that others will agree that our products are non-infringing. We receive direct and indirect claims of intellectual property infringement (including offers to sell us licenses), have been involved in lawsuits, and could become subject to other lawsuits, in which it is alleged that we have infringed upon the patent or other intellectual property rights of other companies. Our involvement in existing and future intellectual property litigation, or the costs of avoiding litigation by purchasing licenses rights or by other means, could result in significant expense to our company, adversely affecting sales of the challenged product or technologies and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor. In the event of an adverse outcome as a defendant in any such litigation, we may be required to: 

   
  •  pay substantial damages;  
  
  •  indemnify our customers for damages they might suffer if the products they purchase from us violate the intellectual property rights of others;  
  
  •  stop our manufacture, use, sale or importation of infringing products;  
  
  •  expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies;  
  
  •  discontinue manufacturing processes; or  
  
  •  obtain licenses to the intellectual property we are found to have infringed.  


      We cannot assure you that we would be successful in such development or acquisition or that such licenses would be available under reasonable terms. Any such development, acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources. 

      We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business. 

      We have made nine acquisitions of various sizes since we became an independent company in 1997, and we plan to pursue additional acquisitions of related businesses. We believe the semiconductor industry is going through a period of consolidation, and we expect to participate in this development. The costs of acquiring and integrating related businesses, or our failure to integrate them successfully into our existing businesses, could 

13 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Table of Contents

result in our company incurring unanticipated expenses and losses. In addition, we may not be able to identify or finance additional acquisitions or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions we do complete. 
      We are constantly pursuing acquisition opportunities and consolidation possibilities and are in various stages of due diligence or preliminary discussions with respect to a number of potential transactions, some of which would be significant. No material potential transactions are subject to a letter of intent or otherwise so far advanced as to make the transaction reasonably certain. 

      If we acquire another business, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Some of the risks associated with acquisitions include: 

   
  •  unexpected losses of key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired company;  
  
  •  conforming the acquired company’s standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;  
  
  •  coordinating new product and process development;  
  
  •  hiring additional management and other critical personnel;  
  
  •  negotiating with labor unions; and  
  
  •  increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.  


      In addition, we may encounter unforeseen obstacles or costs in the integration of other businesses we acquire. 

      Possible future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. 

      We depend on suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials of acceptable quality. Production time and product costs could increase if we were to lose a primary supplier or if a primary supplier increased the prices of raw materials. Product performance could be affected and quality issues could develop as a result of a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials we use in our products. 

      Our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if the costs of raw materials increased significantly. Results could also be adversely affected if there is a significant degradation in the quality of raw materials used in our products, or if the raw materials give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products, any of which could lead to an increase in customer returns or product warranty claims. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, errors or defects may arise from a supplied raw material and be beyond our detection or control. We purchase raw materials such as silicon wafers, lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and chemicals and gases from a limited number of suppliers on a just-in-time basis. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In addition, we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and test operations to other manufacturers, including Amkor, AUK, Enoch, Wooseok, SPS, NS Electronics (Bangkok) Ltd., Samsung Electronics, and ChipPAC. Our operations and ability to satisfy customer obligations could be adversely affected if our relationships with these subcontractors were disrupted or terminated. 

      Delays in beginning production at new facilities, expanding capacity at existing facilities, implementing new production techniques, or in curing problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions, all could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies. 

      Our manufacturing efficiency is an important factor in our profitability, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and are continuously being modified in an effort to improve yields and product performance. Impurities or

other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields. In the second quarter of 2003, we expect to begin production at a new assembly and test facility in Suzhou, China. We will be transferring production from subcontractors to this new facility. In addition, we are currently engaged in an effort to expand capacity at some of our manufacturing facilities. As is common in the semiconductor industry, we have from time to time experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities or in completing transitions to new manufacturing processes at existing facilities. As a consequence, we have suffered delays in product deliveries or reduced yields. 
      We may experience delays or problems in bringing the new Suzhou factory or other new manufacturing capacity to full production. Such delays, as well as possible problems in achieving acceptable yields, or product delivery delays relating to existing or planned new capacity could result from, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies, any of which could result in a loss of future revenues. Our operating results could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately. 

      More than half of our sales are made by distributors who can terminate their relationships with us with little or no notice. The termination of a distributor could reduce sales and result in inventory returns. 

      Distributors accounted for 61% of our net trade sales for the year ended December 29, 2002. Our top five distributors worldwide accounted for 15% of our net trade sales for the year ended December 29, 2002. As a general rule, we do not have long-term agreements with our distributors and they may terminate their relationships with us with little or no advance notice. Distributors generally offer competing products. The loss of one or more of our distributors, or the decision by one or more of them to reduce the number of our products they offer or to carry the product lines of our competitors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The termination of a significant distributor, whether at our or the distributor’s initiative, or a disruption in the operations of one or more of our distributors, could reduce our net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns. 

      The semiconductor business is very competitive, especially in the markets we serve, and increased competition could reduce the value of an investment in our company. 

      The semiconductor industry is, and the multi-market semiconductor product markets in particular are, highly competitive. Competitors offer equivalent or similar versions of many of our products, and customers may switch from our products to competitors’ products on the basis of price, delivery terms, product performance, quality, reliability and customer service or a combination of any of these factors. Competition is especially intense in the multi-market semiconductor segment because it is relatively easier for customers to switch suppliers of more standardized, multi-market products like ours, compared to switching suppliers of more highly integrated or customized semiconductor products such as processors or system-on-a-chip products, which we do not manufacture. Even in strong markets, price pressures may emerge as competitors attempt to gain a greater market share by lowering prices. Competition in the various markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have and thus are better able to pursue acquisition candidates and can better withstand adverse economic or market conditions. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. 

      We may face product warranty or product liability claims that are disproportionately higher than the value of the products involved. 

      Our products are typically sold at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. For example, our products that are incorporated into a personal computer would be sold for several dollars, whereas the personal computer would be sold by the computer maker for several hundred dollars. Although we maintain rigorous quality control systems, we manufacture and sell approximately 16 billion individual semiconductor devices per year to customers around the world, and in the ordinary course of our business we receive warranty claims for some of these products that are defective or that do not perform to published specifications. Since a defect or failure in our product could give 

15 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Table of Contents

rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved. We attempt, through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts, to limit our liability for defective products to obligations to replace the defective goods or refund the purchase price. Nevertheless, we receive claims for other charges, such as for labor and other costs of replacing defective parts, lost profits and other damages. In addition, our ability to reduce such liabilities may be limited by the laws or the customary business practices of the countries where we do business. And, even in cases where we do not believe we have legal liability for such claims, we may choose to pay for them to retain a customer’s business or goodwill. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in our products, if we are required or choose to pay for the damages that result. 
      Our international operations subject our company to risks not faced by domestic competitors. 

      Through our subsidiaries we maintain significant operations in the Philippines, Malaysia and South Korea and also operate facilities in China and Singapore. We are constructing another facility in China. We have sales offices and customers around the world. Almost three-quarters of our revenues in 2002 were from Asia. The following are risks inherent in doing business on an international level: 

   
  •  economic and political instability;  
  
  •  foreign currency fluctuations;  
  
  •  transportation delays;  
  
  •  trade restrictions;  
  
  •  work stoppages; and  
  
  •  the laws, including tax laws of, and the policies of the United States toward, countries in which we manufacture our products.  


      The power device business subjects our company to risks inherent in doing business in Korea, including labor risk, political risk and currency risk. 

      As a result of the acquisition of the power device business in 1999, we have significant operations in South Korea and are subject to risks associated with doing business there. Korea accounted for 21.5% of our trade sales in 2002. 

      Relations between South Korea and North Korea have been tense over most of South Korea’s history, and recent concerns over North Korea’s nuclear capability have created a global security issue that may adversely affect Korean business and economic conditions. We cannot assure you as to whether or when this situation will be resolved or change abruptly as a result of current or future events. An adverse change in economic or political conditions in South Korea or in its relations with North Korea could have a material adverse effect on our Korean subsidiary and our company. And, in addition to other risks disclosed relating to international operations, some businesses in South Korea are subject to labor unrest. 

      Our power device business’ sales are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars while a significant portion of its costs of goods sold and its operating expenses are denominated in South Korean won. Although we have taken steps to fix the costs subject to currency fluctuations and to balance won revenues and won costs, a significant change in this balance, coupled with a significant change in the value of the won relative to the dollar, could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations. In addition, an unfavorable change in the value of the won could require us to write down our won-denominated assets. 

      We entered into a number of supply and support contracts with Samsung Electronics in connection with our acquisition of its power device business in 1999, most of which have now ended. Any significant decrease in purchases by Samsung Electronics could substantially reduce our financial performance. 

      As a result of the acquisition of Samsung Electronics’ power device business in 1999, we entered into numerous arrangements with Samsung Electronics, including arrangements relating to product sales, designa- 

16 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Table of Contents

tion as a preferred vendor to affiliated Samsung companies and other services. Although most of these arrangements have expired, Samsung Electronics remains a significant customer, due in part to the historical relationship between the business we acquired and its former parents and affiliates. There can be no assurances that these relationships will continue at historical levels. Samsung Electronics (together with its affiliates) is our largest customer, accounting for more than 11% of total trade sales during 2002. Any material adverse change in the purchases of Samsung Electronics could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
      A change in foreign tax laws or a difference in the construction of current foreign tax laws by relevant foreign authorities could result in us not recognizing the benefits we anticipated in connection with the transaction structure used to consummate the acquisition of the power device business. 

      The transaction structure we used for the acquisition of the power device business is based on assumptions about the various tax laws, including withholding tax, and other relevant laws of foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our Korean subsidiary was granted a ten-year tax holiday under Korean law in 1999. The first seven years are tax-free, followed by three years of income taxes at 50% of the statutory rate. In 2000, the tax holiday was extended such that the exemption amounts were increased to 75% in the eighth year and a 25% exemption was added to the eleventh year. If our assumptions about tax and other relevant laws are incorrect, or if foreign taxing jurisdictions were to change or modify the relevant laws, or if our Korean subsidiary were to lose its tax holiday, we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences or lose the benefits anticipated from the transaction structure we used to acquire that business. 

      We plan to significantly expand our manufacturing operations in China and, as a result, will be increasingly subject to risks inherent in doing business in China, which may adversely affect our financial performance. 

      We are building the first phase of an 800,000 square foot assembly and test facility in Suzhou, China, and expect to begin production there in the second quarter of 2003. Although we expect a significant portion of our production from this new facility will be exported out of China, especially initially, we are hopeful that a significant portion of our future revenue will result from the Chinese markets in which our products are sold, and from demand in China for goods that include our products. In addition, since 2000 we have operated an optoelectronics manufacturing facility in Wuxi, China. Our ability to operate in China may be adversely affected by changes in that country’s laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. In addition, our results of operations in China are subject to the economic and political situation there. We believe that our operations in China are in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that China’s central or local governments will not impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures. Changes in the political environment or government policies could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations. In addition, a significant destabilization of relations between China and the United States could result in restrictions or prohibitions on our operations or the sale of our products in China. The legal system of China relating to foreign trade is relatively new and continues to evolve. There can be no certainty as to the application of its laws and regulations in particular instances. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of laws inconsistent. Moreover, there is a high degree of fragmentation among regulatory authorities resulting in uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or transactions. 

      We are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could affect our operations or result in significant expenses. 

      Increasingly stringent environmental regulations restrict the amount and types of pollutants that can be released from our operations into the environment. While the cost of compliance with environmental laws has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations historically, compliance with these and any future regulations could require significant capital investments in pollution control equipment or changes in the way we make our products. In addition, because we use hazardous and other regulated materials in our 

17 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

manufacturing processes, we are subject to risks of liabilities and claims, regardless of fault, resulting from accidental releases, including personal injury claims and civil and criminal fines, any of which could be material to our cash flow or earnings. For example: 
   
  •  we currently are remediating contamination at some of our operating plant sites;  
  
  •  we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at a number of Superfund sites where we (or our predecessors) disposed of wastes in the past; and  
  
  •  significant regulatory and public attention on the impact of semiconductor operations on the environment may result in more stringent regulations, further increasing our costs.  


      Although most of our known environmental liabilities are covered by indemnities from Raytheon Company, National Semiconductor or Samsung Electronics, these indemnities are limited to conditions that occurred prior to the consummation of those transactions with those companies. Moreover, we cannot assure you that their indemnity obligations to us for the covered liabilities will be adequate to protect us. 

      We may not be able to attract or retain the technical or management employees necessary to remain competitive in our industry. 

      Our continued success depends on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel. In the semiconductor industry, the competition for qualified personnel, particularly experienced design engineers and other technical employees, is intense, particularly in the “up” portions of our business cycle, when competitors may try to recruit our most valuable technical employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel or recruit the key personnel we require. 

      A substantial number of shares of our company’s common stock are owned by a limited number of persons, and their interests may conflict with your interests. 

      On December 29, 2002, affiliates of Citigroup Inc., and our directors and executive officers together owned approximately 19.0% of the outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock (including shares underlying vested option held by our directors and executive officers). By virtue of such stock ownership, these persons have the power to significantly influence our affairs and are able to influence the outcome of matters required to be submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and the amendment of our corporate charter and bylaws. Such persons may exercise their influence over us in a manner detrimental to the interests of other stockholders or our bondholders. 

      We are a leveraged company with a debt to equity ratio of approximately 0.7 to 1, which could adversely affect our financial health and limit our ability to grow and compete. 

      At December 29, 2002, we had total long-term debt of $853.2 million and a ratio of debt to equity of approximately 0.7 to 1. 

      Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could 

   
  •  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;  
  
  •  increase the amount of our interest expense, because certain of our borrowings (namely borrowings under our senior credit facility, which is currently undrawn) are at variable rates of interest, which, if interest rates increase and amounts are drawn against the senior credit facility, could result in higher interest expense;  
  
  •  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  
  
  •  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

  •  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities;  
  
  •  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the instruments governing our indebtedness;  
  
  •  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and  
  
  •  limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends. Failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  


      Despite current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness. Incurring more indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described above. 

      We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The indenture governing Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation’s outstanding 5% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2008 does not limit the amount of additional debt that we may incur. Although the terms of the indentures governing Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation’s outstanding 10 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes, its outstanding 10 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes, and the credit agreement relating to the senior credit facility contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. The senior credit facility permits borrowings of up to $300.0 million. As of December 29, 2002, we had $299.2 million, adjusted for outstanding letters of credit, available under this revolving credit facility. If new debt is added to our subsidiaries’ current debt levels, the substantial risks described above would intensify. 

      We may not be able to generate the necessary amount of cash to service our indebtedness, which may require us to refinance our indebtedness or default on our scheduled debt payments. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. 

      Our historical financial results have been, and our future financial results are anticipated to be, subject to substantial fluctuations. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, because our senior credit facility has variable interest rates, the cost of those borrowings will increase if market interest rates increase. If we are unable to meet our expenses and debt obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets or raise equity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. 

      Restrictions imposed by the credit agreement relating to our senior credit facility, the indentures governing Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation’s 10 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes and its 10 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into some business operating and financing arrangements, which could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of potentially profitable business opportunities. 

      The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in most of our debt instruments, such as the credit agreement relating to our senior credit facility, the indenture governing Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation’s 10 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes and the indenture governing its 10 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes may limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interests. These debt instruments impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us that affect our ability to incur additional indebtedness or create liens on our assets, pay dividends, sell assets, engage in mergers or acquisitions, make investments or engage in other business activities. These restrictions could place us at a disadvantage relative to competitors not subject to such limitations.

      In addition, the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility contains other and more restrictive covenants and limits us from prepaying our other indebtedness. The senior credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios. These financial ratios become more restrictive over the life of the senior credit facility. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios. Provided there are no further outstanding balances under our senior credit facility, compliance with these covenants in the credit agreement is not required until March 31, 2003. We expect to be in compliance with all covenants in 2003. After that date, or earlier if we borrow money under the credit facility, a breach of any of these covenants, ratios or restrictions could result in an event of default under the senior credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior credit facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness. If the lenders under the senior credit facility accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness.
