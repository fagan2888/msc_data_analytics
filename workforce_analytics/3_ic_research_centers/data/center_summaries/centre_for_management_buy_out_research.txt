Established in 1986 at the University of Nottingham, CMBOR moved to Imperial College London in 2011.  CMBOR examines company buy-outs with a focus on the often misunderstood private equity buy-outs, transactions which include the purchase of companies collapsing under large debt. Led by Professor Mike Wright, and based in the Department of Innovation & Entrepreneurship, CMBOR studies these activities in order to understand more about the companies being purchased.

CMBOR has a database of over 30,000 companies and produces quarterly reports on buy-out activity, presenting analysed data to the industry and drawing conclusions about company performance. The Centre also undertakes bespoke research projects and supplies data from its resources. Funded by Equistone Partners, CMBOR research and reports are vital to the European private equity industry.

Equistone Partners, a major European buy-out firm, frequently uses CMBOR information in its investment decisions. Christiian Marriott, Investor Relations Partner explains: research is vital to understand the market and assess the impacts of buyouts on the wider economic landscape.

As well as commercial and academic influence, CMBOR supplies comprehensive evidence and analysis for UK and European policy making, allowing governments to develop legislation which can help firms to prosper in uncertain times.\


CMBOR  research findings are contributing to major debates about the value of buyouts. Recent research has shown that if an under-performing firm is bought-out, the company then sees positive improvement in employment conditions, such as greater workforce consultation and productivity. In addition, we found that bought-out firms display greater resilience to environmental and economic instability, so in a recession they have performed relatively better than their counterparts, suggesting that the conditions created by the buyout notably increase the sustainability of the business.

It has been widely assumed that failing firms come with large debts and so are more likely to collapse in the long-term, yet CMBOR studies have shown that there is no discernible difference in failure rates between bought-out and other firms. Buy-outs are an ever-changing area of study and different outcomes will be observed in the boom times and in recessions. Understanding the role of buyouts in the economy and how struggling firms can be enhanced is central to CMBOR\'92s remit, and will ultimately benefit the UK.

CMBOR  also undertakes bespoke research projects on private equity and venture capital for UK and international government agencies, venture capitalists, banks, professional advisors and other clients. The Centre also maintains an important international network of academic and professional collaborators in Western Europe, the CEE countries, North America and Japan.
