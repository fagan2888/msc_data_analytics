Firms, governments and individuals face risks of increasing magnitude and complexity. Important risks affecting societies around the globe include financial risks (as highlighted during the 2007-08 crisis) but also risks related to climate change and aging. Financial stability at both a firm and economy-wide level depends crucially on effective risk management and regulation.
The Risk Management Laboratory works closely with academics, private sector firms and public sector bodies on common research initiatives, training and workshops.
Aims of the Risk Management Laboratory
* to develop innovative and high quality programmes of academic research
* to work closely with a select group of private and public sector organisations to develop practical solutions to their risk problems
* to provide a forum for academics, regulators and the industry to exchange views
* to influence policy debates affecting the financial industry by bringing together academic researchers, senior regulators and top industry representatives
* to create fruitful research links between experts in financial analysis in the Business School and researchers looking at aspects of risk in other Imperial faculties
