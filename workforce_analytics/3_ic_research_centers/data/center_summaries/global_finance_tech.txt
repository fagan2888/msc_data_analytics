Understanding the impact of technology on finance, business, and society.

serves as a hub for multidisciplinary research, business education and global outreach aimed at greater understanding of the impact of technology on finance, business and society.


“With the support from Citi, we are launching a new Centre for Global Finance and Technology.

The Centre will be based at the Imperial College Business School and will bring together leading academics to investigate the impact of technology on finance, business and society.

Why fintech? Last year, UK fintech companies secured record funding of well over 500 million pounds. Also, last year the government announced a series of ambitious measures to make UK and London the leading centre of global fintech.

We at the Imperial College Business School recognise that in order to become the leading centre in this area will require both intelligence and business acumen. The new Centre will help bring both together.

To start with, it will support top quality research on blockchain and digital money, automated markets and high frequency trading, clearing, and other tech areas critical to modern finance.

This interdisciplinary, quantitative research will then feed into new courses and executive education programmes at the Business School that can help foster a new generation of fintech experts and re-educate existing talent in new fintech ways.

The Centre will also work on providing intellectual guidance to key policymakers and regulators.”
