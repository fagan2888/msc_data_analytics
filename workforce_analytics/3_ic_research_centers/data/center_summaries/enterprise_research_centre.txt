The Enterprise Research Centre (ERC) was established in February 2013 to answer one central question, What drives SME Growth
Our research is divided into six main research themes \'96 Ambition, Business Demography, Diversity, Finance and Governance, Innovation and Exporting and Leadership.

The Centre aspires to become the international focal point for research, knowledge and expertise on SME growth and entrepreneurship.

The strategic management of the Centre is the responsibility of the Senior Management Team, with support from Centre Managers. Each research theme is led by a senior academic with contributions from a range of academic staff across the partner institutions. Find out more.

We also work with a range of researchers, both in the UK and overseas who are affiliated with the Centre through their research interests and collaboration. This diverse group are allied with the theme(s) that relate to their research interests. Find out more.

The operation of the Centre is supported by a Funders Group which monitors the programme of work and contributes to the research agenda. We also have an independent Advisory Group which includes representatives from business groups and business support practitioners.
