Understanding financial behaviour for robust policy making

The Centre dramatically enhances Imperial College Business Schoolâ€™s expertise in financial economics and strengthens ties with other disciplines including engineering and computational finance.

A key objective of the new initiative will be to disseminate rigorous, world-class research to reach and engage business practitioners, policy-makers, legislators and the wider public, as well as other academic experts. The new Centre will serve as a bridge between the Business School and the world of business, aiming to develop a greater understanding and more efficient management of risk, and to promote investment and productivity.

Though the research agenda of the centre has yet to be decided, its mission is to understand better what drives financial behaviour and thereby to help create a more robust policy underpinning
