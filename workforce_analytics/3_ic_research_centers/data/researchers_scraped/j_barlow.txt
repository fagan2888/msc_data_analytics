I have a PhD from the London School of Economics and a background in geography and economics.For the last 15 years my research, teaching and consultancy has focused on the adoption, implementation and sustainability of innovation in healthcare systems. I have led or been involved in many research and consulting projects around the world. Prior to 2000 I was largely working on innovation in housing provision and other housing policy issues, including construction and supply chain innovation.I have extensive experience advising and consulting for government, health services and industry. I have worked extensively with companies involved in healthcare technologies from the medical devices, ICT, telecoms and pharmaceutical sectors. I was a member of the healthcare advisory board for MITIE Group plc and chaired the healthcare advisory board for Willmott Dixon Construction Ltd.
