After spending two years as a British Academy Post-doctoral Research Fellow, Dmitry took up the post of Assitant Professor in August 2015.Dmitry's research interests lie at the intersections of the literatures on competitive strategy, innovation management, and decision-making under uncertainty. His current research aims to improve our understanding (1) of competitive dynamics under uncertainty, using data from the America's Cup World Series sailing competition (working together with Jan-Michael Ross), (2) of innovation and the inventive process, using data on all inventions created by the employees of a large multinational firm operating in a complex-goods industry (working together with Paola Criscuolo, Oliver Alexy, and Ammon Salter), and (3) of competition within and between innovation ecosystems, in the context of the changes taking place in the telecommunications sector over the past decades (working together with a number of co-authors including Erkko Autio, Llewellyn Thomas, Bilgehan Uzunca and Richard Tee).Dmitry teaches Entrepreneurship and Corporate Strategy, and has also taught and coached on the Innovation and Entrepreneurship summer school.                                                                                     Publications                                                              Ross J-M, Sharapov D, 2015, WHEN THE LEADER FOLLOWS: AVOIDING DETHRONEMENT THROUGH IMITATION, Academy of Management Journal, Vol:58, ISSN:0001-4273, Pages:658-679                                                                           DOI                                       Author Web Link                                                                                                                              Sivonen P, Borella P, Thomas LDW, et al.Sivonen P, Borella P, Thomas LDW, Sharapov D close, 2015, How an accelerator can catalyse your ecosystem, The European Business Review, ISSN:1754-5501                                                                           Open Access Link                                                                                                                              Rihoux B, Marx A, 2013, QCA, 25 Years after "The Comparative Method": Mapping, Challenges, and Innovations--Mini-Symposium, Political Research Quarterly, Vol:66, ISSN:1065-9129, Pages:167-235                                                                           DOI                                                                                                                              Kattuman PA, Rodriguez D, Sharapov D, et al.Kattuman PA, Rodriguez D, Sharapov D, Velazquez FJ close, 2011, REVISITING PROFITABILITY: FIRM, BUSINESS GROUP, INDUSTRY AND COUNTRY EFFECTS, Academy of Management Proceedings, Vol:2011, ISSN:0065-0668, Pages:1-6                                                                           DOI                                                                                                                              Sharapov D, Ross J, 1900, Whom should a leader imitate in multiple competitor settings?
