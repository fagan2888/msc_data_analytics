Decision makers in the domains of strategy, innovation, and entrepreneurship may want to capture opportunities arising in those dynamic environments. Succesful managers will have to find answers to challenging questions, such asWhen should we adopt a new technology and replace existing ones?Should we develop/launch new products now or later? Is it worth it increasing our R&D budget?Whom should we compete with and what defines our competitive arena? How can we catch up with the market leader? (vice versa: How to avoid getting dethroned by laggards?)Jan’s research seeks to provide solutions to such questions, by developing normative insights that answers when to imitate vs innovate, delay vs commit, focus vs diversify, and stabilise vs create flexibility.His research provides solutions for business leaders on how to successfully manage the link between a firm’s current actions and its uncertain futures, capitalise on new opportunities, and how to outperform rivals. Brief vita: Jan studied Business Administration at the universities of Kiel and Hohenheim (Germany).
