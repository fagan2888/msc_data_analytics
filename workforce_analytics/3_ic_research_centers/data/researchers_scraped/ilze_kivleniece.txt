Among her principal research areas, are 1) the emergence and design of novel hybrid organizational forms addressing pressing social needs and concerns, 2) governance mechanisms and models underlying multi-actor and public-private sector collaboration, and 3) the impact of social interests and political pressures on firm strategy, boundary choices and performance. Her current empirical work is set in infrastructure and project-based industries, with a particular focus on the global water and sanitation sector.
