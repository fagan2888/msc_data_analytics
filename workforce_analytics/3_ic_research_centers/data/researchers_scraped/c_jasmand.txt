She holds a Dipl.-Kffr. degree in International Business Studies from the University of Paderborn (Germany) and earned an MSc degree in International Business as well as a PhD degree in marketing from Maastricht University School of Business and Economics (The Netherlands). From 2010 to 2011, she was a visiting scholar at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business, University of Michigan (US).Her research interests center on effective customer-employee interfaces and interactions for superior value co-creation. She addresses the management of both employee behavior and customer behavior as well as their interdependencies. One of the phenomena she explores is the practice of cross-/up-selling in customer service channels (also called: sales through service). A related article has been published in the prestigious Journal of Marketing. Other research projects address the management of the customer contact employees' role in new product and service development and the integration of customers in such processes. While she primarily relies on quantitative research methods (survey and experiment based), she is also interested in qualitative methods (e.g., the quality of case study based research).Claudia taught marketing courses in the Msc Management and Joint Honours & iBSc programs and currently teaches the Marketing Plan Competition course in the MSc Strategic Marketing program.
