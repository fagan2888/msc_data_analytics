Repec page Papers My  work on the contribution of science to economic growth was kindly extensively quoted by ministers in the run up to the 2010 Spending Review where the science budget escaped large cuts.  Here is a video of me talking about why the science budget should be defended. Short research statementMy main research interests are productivity, innovation, intangible investment and growth.  I currently study (a) how much firms investment in “intangible” or "knowledge" assets, such as software, R&D and new business processes (b) how much such investment contributes to economic growth as whole and (c) what public policy implications there might be, especially for science policy.  This work uses a mix of data at the levelsof company, individual, industry and whole economy.Jonathan’s C.V. My blogMy twitter accountLink to Google ScholarFull contact detailsProf. Jonathan HaskelImperial College Business SchoolSouth Kensingon Campus,Tanaka Building, Room 296Exhibition RoadLondon SW7 2AZUKE: j.haskel@ic.ac.ukT: +44-20 7594 8563T: +44-20 7594 1916(Administrator)F: +44-20 7594 5915W: www.imperial.ac.uk/people/j.haskel                                                                                    Publications                                                              Haskel J, 2015, Understanding innovation better: an intangible investment approach, Asia-pacific Journal of Accounting &amp;
