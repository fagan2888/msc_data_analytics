//Summary                                                                                                                                                                 Summary                                Mirjam Tuk joined Imperial College in November 2011. Prior to that she heldpositions at the University of Groningen and the University of Twente, both inThe Netherlands. She obtained her PhD in Marketing from the RotterdamSchool of Management, Erasmus University in the Netherlands in 2008. She held a visiting professor position at INSEAD from 2011 until 2014. She is currently a visiting professor at the Rotterdam School of Management.Mirjam’s primary research areas are consumer self-control processes and interpersonal influence processes. In her work on self-control processes, she examines determinants of self-control improvement. Her work in this domain has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General and Psychological Science. Among others, she shows that visceral factors that induce an increased state of control (e.g.bladder control)  influence and  boost behavioral self-control ability. This research has been awarded the 2011 IgNobel award in Medicine. It has received extensive international radio and newspaper coverage by, among others, The Economist Intelligent Life, The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, Fox News,Newsweek, BBC radio, CNN and MSNBC. It was also featured in the sitcom "Big Bang Theory". Her work in the area of interpersonal influence focuses on word-of-mouth referral behavior. She examines how marketing stimulated referrals alter word-of-mouth interactions, and potentially diminish the well-known effectiveness of word-of-mouth recommendations. Her work in this area has appeared in the Journal of Consumer Psychology, the Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science and the European Journal of Social Psychology.
