//Summary                                                                                                                                                                 Summary                                Sankalp Chaturvedi is an Associate Professor (Organisational Behavior & Leadership) at the Imperial College Business School. Currently, Sankalp is also leading the Gandhi Centre within the School. He holds a PhD from the NUS Business School, National University of Singapore. Prior to his PhD, he has a Masters in Human Resource Development and Management from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (India) and a Bachelors in Engineering from RAU, Udaipur (India).The central focus of Sankalp’s research is in the areas of Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB), Leadership, and Interpersonal Trust. Specifically, he is interested in the role of both individual factors (motivational orientations anchored in promotion vs. prevention-focus) and situational factors anchored in promotion vs. prevention (e.g., leadership, trust), and how they jointly influence OCB as a dynamic of regulatory fit. In addition, Sankalp is also interested in examining the “nature vs. nurture” debates with regard to behaviors in organizations. He uses twin-sampling methodology to advance the understanding of the biological basis of behavior. Furthermore, his research on interpersonal trust attempts to delineate dimensionality of the trust dimensions and explore how these dimensions develop over time.Sankalp has been an active participant and reviewer in several international conferences like the Academy of Management and the Society of Industrial and Organizational Psychology. His articles have been published/ accepted in the Journal of Applied Psychology, Organizational Behavior & Human Decision Processes, Strategic Management Journal, Leadership Quarterly, Journal of Management , Journal of Vocational Behavior, Entrepreneurship Theory & Practice,  Energy Policy and Academy of Management Best Paper Proceedings, among others.
