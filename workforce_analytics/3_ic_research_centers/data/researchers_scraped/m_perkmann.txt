His current projects investigate the engagement of academic scientists with industry and the commercialization of science. He is also interested in hybrid organizations, particularly at the interface between public science, industry and society. He explores how intermediary organizations can help bring together basic science and the pharmaceutical industry to discover new drugs, and how university-industry centres can successfully deal with the conflicting demands of science and business.Markus welcomes PhD applications in the areas of science organization & business, university-industry relations and organization theory.
