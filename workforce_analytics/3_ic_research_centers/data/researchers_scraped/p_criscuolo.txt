It also tests using patent citation analysis whether other home-country firms can benefit from R&D performed abroad by domestic MNEs.During her doctoral studies Paola has spent a year as visiting PhD student at the Clore Management School, Birkbeck College, University of London, where she lectured in managerial economics, and three years at the Science and Technology Policy Research Unit (SPRU ) at the University of Sussex, first as a Marie Curie fellow, funded by the European Commission, and then as a Research Officer.Paola joined the Business School in October 2004 as a Research Associate working with Ammon Salter on a EPSRC-funded research project which analyses the evolution of networks and capabilities in two engineering consulting firms (ARUP and WS Atkins ). Her main research interests are R&D internationalization, knowledge management, knowledge integration, methodological issues related to patents and patent citation analysis, social network analysis.Paola has been a member of several international collaborative projects on innovation issues and has published six articles in refereed journals and several working papers, and has also presented her work on numerous occasions to conferences.Education / QualificationsBA in Economics from the faculty of Scienze Economiche e Bancarie of the University of Siena in 1998.
