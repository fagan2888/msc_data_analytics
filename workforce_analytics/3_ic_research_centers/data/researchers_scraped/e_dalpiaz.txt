//Summary                                                                                                                                                                 Summary                                Dr. Elena Dalpiaz is Assistant Professor of Strategy. She holds a PhD degree from Bocconi University, where she also earned her BA in Economics and Law (with honours). During 2007 and 2008, she was a visiting scholar at the University of Texas at Austin, McCombs Business School.Elena's research is theoretically grounded in the areas of strategy and organization theory, and it focuses on two main streams: the organizational use of cultural resources for strategy formation and organizational change, and the management of corporate reputation. Cultural resources are theorized as firm's cultural and symbolic capital, concepts, and institutional logics. Elena studies firms' process of change through the enrichment of their cultural repertoires with cultural resources from different registers, and the consequent achievement of strategic versatility and strategic innovations. Current research projects explore the organizational processes that allow firms to use contradictory institutional logics in order to bridge different fields. Furthermore, Elena investigates the processes of, and conditions for, the emergence of collective reputation of firms.Elena teaches competitive strategy both at the undergraduate (engineering and medicine students) and graduate level (students at MSc programmes), and she has taught courses of strategic management in creative industries and international management.
