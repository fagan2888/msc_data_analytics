Prior to joining Imperial, she was a faculty member in the School of Management at the Queensland University of Technology, Australia. Dr Malhotra has an MPhil in Commerce from the Delhi School of Economics, India and a PhD in Organizational Analysis from the University of Alberta, Canada. Dr Malhotra's research interests lie in the areas of organizational change and institutional change drawing on both organizational theory and strategy. To date, her research projects have predominantly focused on examining change processes in professional service firms especially law firms. She has also done research on internationalization strategies of engineering consulting firms. Currently, Namrata is working on a project examining micro-processes of institutional change unfolding in law firms with the emergence of innovative career models. She is also involved in a project focused on the British nuclear industry. She is investigating how institutional complexity faced by this high risk industry has shaped key structural and strategic changes mediated by changing perceptions of risk over time.  She teaches courses in strategic management, managing change in organizations and organizational behaviour at the graduate and undergraduate level. She also teaches on Executive Education programs at Imperial and other institutions. Currently, she is an International Research Fellow in the Novak Druce Centre for Professional Service Firms, Said Business School, University of Oxford.                                                                                     Publications                                                              Malhotra N, Hinings CRB, 2015, Unpacking Continuity and Change as a Process of Organizational Transformation, Long Range Planning, Vol:48, ISSN:0024-6301, Pages:1-22                                                                           DOI                                                                                                                              Lawrence TB, Malhotra N, Morris T, 2012, Episodic and Systemic Power in the Transformation of Professional Service Firms, Journal of Management Studies, Vol:49, ISSN:0022-2380, Pages:102-143                                                                           DOI                                       Author Web Link                                                                                                                              Malhotra N, Hinings CRB, 2010, An organizational model for understanding internationalization processes, Journal of International Business Studies, Vol:41, ISSN:0047-2506, Pages:330-349                                                                           DOI                                       Author Web Link                                                                                                                              Malhotra N, Morris T, Smets M, 2010, New career models in UK professional service firms: from up-or-out to up-and-going-nowhere?, International Journal of Human Resource Management, Vol:21, ISSN:0958-5192, Pages:1396-1413                                                                           DOI                                       Author Web Link                                                                                                                              Malhotra N, Morris T, 2009, Heterogeneity in Professional Service Firms, Journal of Management Studies, Vol:46, ISSN:0022-2380, Pages:895-922                                                                           DOI                                       Author Web Link                                                                                              More Publications                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      //Links                                                                                                                                                                                                                  College Directory                                                                                                                 Search College Directory                                                                                                                Business School                                                                                                                Expert Directory                                                                                                                                                                                                                             //News
