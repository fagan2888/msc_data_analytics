His current research focuses on the setting of monetary policy in the wake of the financial crash and explores the nature of unconventional policy and the links to financial stability.He is involved with the co-ordination between monetary policy and financial stability. One strand of research which reflects this is on the use of macro-prudential policy tools and, specifically, the setting of bank capital requirements. His March 2013 paper (“Optimal Bank capital”, Economic Journal) explores the appropriate way to set bank capital requirements.Future work will focus on how liquidity requirements and the setting of monetary policy interacts with capital requirements. His recent paper on unconventional monetary policy (Economic Journal, November 2012) looks at the evidence for the effectiveness of central bank asset purchases and other non-standard policies. This is an on-going area of research – as recent public lectures below (more details in cv) illustrate.Recent Public Lectures:LSE, 30 September 2014"Mensch tracht, und Gott lacht: Giving guidance on future monetary policy"View a video recording of the speechMile End Group, February 2014.“The Transition to a New normal for Monetary Policy”Video of the eventDallas Federal Reserve, November 2013 “Housing, leverage and stability in the wider economy”Institute for Policy Research Lecture, University of Bath, February 2013 “What should Monetary Policy Do?”Scottish Economic Society Annual Lecture, Edinburgh, September 2012 “Winding and Unwinding Extraordinary Monetary Policy”North American Business Economists Lecture, Washington, March 2012 “Government Debt and Unconventional Monetary Policy”CEPR Public Policy Lecture, London, February 2011  “Monetary Policy in Extraordinary Times”Forthcoming publications:Miles, D “Inflation, Employment and Monetary Policy: Objectives and Outcomes in the UK and US Compared”, forthcoming, Journal of Money, Credit and BankingMiles, D "Housing, leverage and stability in the wider economy”, forthcoming, Journal of Money, Credit and BankingMiles, D and Schanz, J “The Relevance or Otherwise of the Central Bank’s Balance sheet”, forthcoming in Journal of International EconomicsPapers in progress:Miles, D and Du, Chuan  Capital Requirements, Monetary Policy and the Fundamental Problem of Bank Risk TakingDu, Chuan and Miles D "Interaction Between Monetary Policy and Regulatory Capital Requirements"Miles, D and Schanz, J “Should central banks provide reserves via repos or outright bond purchases?"
