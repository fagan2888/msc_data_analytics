//Summary                                                                                                                                                                 Summary                                I am a Fellow at Imperial College Business School, London. I hold a PhD in Management (2008) and a Laurea in Management Engineering (2003) from the University of Bologna in Italy. Before joining Imperial College London, I researched at Ecole des Mines de Paris, France (2007), Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, USA (2007-2009), and the University of Bozen, Italy (2009-2010).My research focuses on the individual-level determinants of entrepreneurship. My overall objective is to contribute to the theoretical debate on the foundation of entrepreneurial activities, explaining heterogeneity, deviance and success in their enactment. More specifically, using social-cognitive theories and drawing on institutional approaches, I theoretically address the determinants of entrepreneurial behaviours, such as the creation of new values within existing firms, the enactment of knowledge transfer activities from university to industry and the decision to establish new ventures.My research was featured in Nature, Times Higher Education and The New York Times.You can access my scholarly papers at the following link: http://ssrn.com/author=652278                                                                                    Publications                                                              Perkmann M, Fini R, Ross J-M, et al.Perkmann M, Fini R, Ross J-M, Salter A, Silvestri C, Tartari V close, 2015, Accounting for universities' impact: using augmented data to measure academic engagement and commercialization by academic scientists, Research Evaluation, Vol:24, ISSN:0958-2029, Pages:380-391                                                                           DOI                                       Author Web Link                                                                                                                              Bolzani D, Fini R, Grimaldi R, et al.Bolzani D, Fini R, Grimaldi R, Sobrero M close, 2014, University spin-offs and their impact: Longitudinal evidence from Italy, Economia E Politica Industriale, Vol:41, ISSN:0391-2078, Pages:237-263                                                                                                                                                                  Baldini N, Fini R, Grimaldi R, et al.Baldini N, Fini R, Grimaldi R, Sobrero M close, 2014, Organisational Change and the Institutionalisation of University Patenting Activity in Italy, Minerva, Vol:52, ISSN:0026-4695, Pages:27-53                                                                           DOI                                       Author Web Link                                                                                                                              Perkmann M, Tartari V, McKelvey M, et al.Perkmann M, Tartari V, McKelvey M, Autio E, Brostrom A, D'Este P, Fini R, Geuna A, Grimaldi R, Hughes A, Krabel S, Kitson M, Llerena P, Lissoni F, Salter A, Sobrero M close, 2013, Academic engagement and commercialisation: A review of the literature on university-industry relations, Research Policy, Vol:42, ISSN:0048-7333, Pages:423-442                                                                           DOI                                       Author Web Link                                                                                                                              Perkmann M, Tartari V, McKelvey M, et al.Perkmann M, Tartari V, McKelvey M, Autio E, Brostrom A, D'Este P, Fini R, Geuna A, Grimaldi R, Hughes A, Kitson M, Krabel S, Llerena P, Lissoni F, Salter A, Sobrero M close, 2013, Academic Engagement and Commercialisation: A Review of the Literature on University Relations with Industry, Research Policy                                                                           Author Web Link                                                                                              More Publications                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      //Links                                                                                                                                                                                                                  College Directory                                                                                                                 Search College Directory                                                                                                                Business School                                                                                                                Expert Directory                                                                                                                                                                                                                             //News
