(4) Nature’s Best Frozen Foods company produces 4 mixes of frozen ready-to-eat vegetables. The mixes consists of five different vegetables: carrots, mushrooms, green peppers, broccoli and corn. The mixes are “Stir Fry”, “Barbecue”, “Hearty Mushrooms” and “Veggie Crunch”, and each mix is sold in 250g bags. Each bag of “Stir Fry”, “Barbecue”, “Hearty Mushrooms” and “Veggie Crunch” contributes £0.22, £0.20, £0.18 and £0.18 to the company’s earnings, respectively.

(a) Assuming that the company can sell all the mixes that they produce, formulate a linear program that determines a production plan which maximises the total earnings.
